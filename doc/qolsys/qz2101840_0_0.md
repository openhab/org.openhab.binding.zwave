## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The QZ2101-840 / STW-W3350WU supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Association group 1 is assigned to Plugs status - On/Off. Allows for receiving control command from trigger devices whenever the Plug is turned On or Off.
Association group 1 is assigned to Plugs status - On/Off. Allows for receiving control command from trigger devices whenever the Plug is turned On or Off.

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: group 2

Association group 2 reports relay's status to just one device, Z-Wave network's main controller by default. It's not recommended to modify settings of this association group.
Association group 2 reports relay's status to just one device, Z-Wave network's main controller by default. It's not recommended to modify settings of this association group.

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.
