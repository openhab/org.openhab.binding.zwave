# LZW31-SN Red Series Dimmer
This describes the Z-Wave device *LZW31-SN*, manufactured by *Inovelli* with the thing type UID of ```inovelli_lzw31sn_00_000```.

The device is in the category of *Wall Switch*, defining Any device attached to the wall that controls a binary status of something, for ex. a light switch.

The LZW31-SN supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

Inovelli’s new dimmer switch is packed with features and designed with your house in mind.

From a hardware side we’ve upgraded our Z-Wave module for better distance and there is no longer a need for a neutral wire. The switch can be used in any 3-Way or 4-Way setting and allows you to use either an auxiliary switch, a smart switch or your existing dumb switch (NOTE: this only applies if a neutral wire is installed. If there is no neutral wire, the switch only works in a single-pole setting).

From a firmware side, this switch has it all (literally). Scene control, notifications (flashes if your garage door is left open) and can be configured on any HUB.

==

Important:  If you have a neutral wire, set parameter 21 correctly.  If setting the switch up in a 3-way configuration, set parameter 22 (you may need to enable advanced settings to see this).

### Inclusion Information

Once the inclusion process has started press the config button 3X and the LED bar will flash blue.  If the switch was included successfully the bar will turn GREEN, however if the switch was not included successfully it will turn RED.

### Exclusion Information

Put your HUB in Exclusion mode and press the Config Button 3X until your HUB says the device is excluded.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The LZW31-SN supports 4 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Members of this group will receive unsolicited messages related to the status of the switch.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Basic Set

Single press UP button sends BasicSet (0xFF) and single press Down sends BasicSet (0x00)

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Switch Multilevel Set

Sends dim/brighten commands to associated device when switch is pressed.

Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 4: Switch Multilevel Start/Stop

Sends start and stop level changes to associated devices.

Association group 4 supports 5 nodes.
