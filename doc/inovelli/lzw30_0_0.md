The LZW30 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

The Inovelli On/Off switch is a Z-Wave device that controls attached LED, CFL, & Incandescent lighting which can be highly customized to your liking at the switch itself with our unique config button and advanced firmware.

 Configuration/Favorites Button: This switch allows for ultimate customization via the Configuration Button (rather than via a Z-Wave HUB) such as the power on state, LED Indicator Color, LED Indicator Intensity, and LED Indicator Intensity (When Off). 

OTA (Over-the-Air) Enabled: As with all our devices, the switch allows you to receive our latest firmware updates (NOTE: Please make sure your HUB supports this).

### Inclusion Information

Now that the switch is physically installed, let’s start the inclusion (pairing) process.

  * Restore power to your switch and if wired properly, the LED bar will light up (should flash a series of colors, then turn blue)
  * Start the inclusion process on your HUB/Gateway
  * Press the config button (A) 3x and the LED bar should pulse blue (if it doesn’t, try pressing the buttons faster or slower) indicating the switch is in inclusion mode. If successful, the switch LED Bar (B) will turn Green. If unsuccessful, the LED Bar will turn RED.
  * **Z-Wave Range Check:** Easily check whether or not your switch is within range by holding the Config Button (A) for 5-10 seconds. The LED bar will indicate: RED = Not in Range, or = Within Range GREEN (Good Signal).

**Final Thoughts / Tips: **If you’re having issues pairing your switch, there’s a couple things you can try. The first one is to hold down the config button for 5 seconds until the LED bar indicates RED or GREEN, where RED = Not in Range, or = Within Range GREEN (Good Signal). If the signal is GREEN, then let’s try an exclusion to reset your switch.

### Exclusion Information

  * Start the exclusion process on your HUB/Gateway
  * Press, “Remove” and tap the Config button 3x and the LED bar should pulse blue
  * The LED bar should flash GREEN if successful

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The LZW30 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Members of this group will receive unsolicited messages related to the status of the switch.  
1. Basic Report 2. Device Reset Locally 3. Protection Report

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Basic Set

  1. Single press Up button sends BasicSet (0xFF)  
    and
  2. Single press Down sends BasicSet (0x00)

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.
