The LZW31 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

For starters, we’ve upgraded our Z-Wave module for better distance. The switch can be used in any 3-Way or 4-Way setting and allows you to use either an auxiliary switch, a smart switch or your existing dumb switch (NOTE: this only applies if a neutral wire is installed. If there is no neutral wire, the switch only works in a single-pole setting).

Lastly, the LED bar can be changed to any default color you’d prefer and also allows for it to be dimmed, or disabled altogether.

### Inclusion Information

Start the Inclusion process on your HUB/Gateway. Turn the power back on and auto-inclusion will activate.You will have 60 seconds before it times out. If it does timeout,the backup method to pair/include the device is to press the Config Button (A) 3 times.

### Exclusion Information

Put your HUB in Exclusion mode and press the Config Button (A) 3x until your HUB says the device is excluded.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the LZW31 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The LZW31 supports 4 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Basic Set


Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Switch Multilevel Set


Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 4: Control multiple bulbs / dimmers with level change


Association group 4 supports 5 nodes.
