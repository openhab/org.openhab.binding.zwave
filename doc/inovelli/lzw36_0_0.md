# LZW36 Fan & Light Switch
This describes the Z-Wave device *LZW36*, manufactured by *Inovelli* with the thing type UID of ```inovelli_lzw36_00_000```.

The device is in the category of *Wall Switch*, defining Any device attached to the wall that controls a binary status of something, for ex. a light switch.

The LZW36 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

There are two different wireless protocols that are used to make this fan & light switch - Z-Wave and RF.

Z-Wave is what gives the switch remote (smart) control, whereas RF is what connects the switch to the module. In other words, your hub/gateway connects to your switch, where you can tell it to change the speed of the fan or the brightness of the lights. From there the switch sends an RF command to the module to physically make those commands happen at the fan itself.

### Inclusion Information

Enable the inclusion process on your Hub or Gateway. Hold down button A and press button B 3x quickly and your LED Bars will pulse blue signifying the switch is in inclusion mode. If successful, the switch LED Bars will flash Green and if unsuccessful, the LED Bars will flash Red.

### Exclusion Information

Place your hub or gateway into exclusion mode. Then: Hold button A + Press Button B 3x. If it is successful the LED will blink green.

### General Usage Information

**A**. Light Dimmer (and Scene Control*): This button can be used to increase or decrease the dimness level on your light. Press (hold) up to increase brightness and press (hold) down to decrease the brightness. Also, a single press will send a scene command to your hub.

**B**. Light On/Off Button (and Scene Control*): Press this button to turn on and off the fan light(s). This button can also be used to trigger Z-Wave scenes. You may add up to 7 scenes (Tap x, 2x, 3x, 4x, 5x, Hold, Release).

**C**. Light RGB LED Bar (with Notifications*): Shows the level at which the fan light(s) are set at. In addition, it can be used as a notifier for various events (i.e.: turn purple if front door is open).

**D**. Fan Speed (and Scene Control*): This button can be used to increase or decrease the speed of your fan. Press (hold) up to increase the speed and press (hold) down to decrease the speed. Also, a single press will send a scene command to your hub.

**E**. Fan On/Off Button (and Scene Control*): Press this button to turn on and off the fan. This button can also be used to trigger Z-Wave scenes. You may add up to 7 scenes (Tap x, 2x, 3x, 4x, 5x, Hold, Release).

**F**. Light RGB LED Bar (with Notifications*): Shows the level at which the fan speed is set at. In addition, it can be used as a notifier for various events (i.e.: turn red when your alarm is armed).

**G**. Air Gap Switch: This will reboot the switch if it needs to be rebooted (NOTE: The air-gap switch will not cut power to the module).NOT SHOWN: Energy Monitoring\* and Scene Control\* are built-in features of this switch as well

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The LZW36 supports 7 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Members of this group will receive unsolicited messages related to the status of the switch.
