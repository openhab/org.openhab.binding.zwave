The VZW31-SN supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

Introducing Z-Wave's first certified 800 Series Light Switch powered by Inovelli. Featuring Z-Wave Long Range which boasts open air signal of up to 1 mile, government level encryption and security, multi-tap scene control, LED notifications, power monitoring and over 60 parameters, this smart switch has it all. Best of all, it was developed by 1,000's of community members, which makes this truly a switch for the smart home enthusiast.

### Inclusion Information

When you are ready to include/pair your switch, please start the inclusion process on your Z-Wave enabled hub. If you are unsure how to do that, please refer to the specific hub instructions here:

Once your hub has started the inclusion process, quickly tap three (3) times on the configuration/favorites button and the LED Bar will start to pulse blue.

If your switch includes successfully, the LED Bar will blink Green temporarily and then go back to Blue. If the switch does not include successfully, the LED Bar will blink Red temporarily and then go back to Blue.

**Note:** If you run into issues where your switch is not including, you may have to try an exclusion process. To exclude your switch, start the exclusion process on your hub and then tap the config/favorites button 3x rapidly. If you continue to have issues after an exclusion, you may have to move the switch closer to the hub.

### Exclusion Information

Exclusion will reset your device as well and can be done directly from the hub. This is helpful if you’re running into issues with inclusion. To exclude a device, start the exclusion process on your hub and press the Configuration / Favorites Button 3x rapidly. The LED Bar will start pulsing blue and if successful, it will flash green. If unsuccessful it will flash red.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The VZW31-SN supports 6 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Members of this group will receive unsolicited messages related to the status of the switch

Association group 1 supports 10 nodes.

### Group 2: Basic Set

Sends On & Off commands to associated devices

1. Single press on the up button sends BasicSet (0xFF)

2. Single press on the down button sends BasicSet (0x00)

Association group 2 supports 10 nodes.

### Group 3: Switch Multilevel Set

Sends set level commands to associated devices when switch is pressed.

1. Release up or down button sends Switch MultiLevelSet which keeps associated devices in sync with this device

2. Single press on the up button sends SwitchMultiLevelSet (0xFF)

3. Single press on the down button sends SwitchMultiLevelSet (0x00)

4. If param. 53 = 1, 2x press up sends SwitchMultiLevelSet to P55

5. If param. 54 = 1, 2x press down sends SwitchMultiLevelSet to P56

Association group 3 supports 10 nodes.

### Group 4: Switch Multilevel Start/Stop

Sends start / stop level change to associated devices (only in dimmer mode)

1. Hold up button sends SW\_MULTILEVEL\_START\_LEVEL\_CHANGE (Up)

2. Hold down button sends SW\_MULTILEVEL\_START\_LEVEL\_CHANGE (Down)

3. Release either button sends SW\_MULTILEVEL\_STOP\_LEVEL\_CHANGE

Association group 4 supports 10 nodes.

### Group 5: Double-Tap Basic Set

Sends On & Off commands to associated devices

1. 2x/3x press on the up button sends BasicSet (0xFF)

2. 2x/3x press on the down button sends BasicSet (0x00)

Association group 5 supports 10 nodes.

### Group 6: Triple-Tap Basic Set

Sends On & Off commands to associated devices

1. 2x/3x press on the up button sends BasicSet (0xFF)

2. 2x/3x press on the down button sends BasicSet (0x00)

Association group 6 supports 10 nodes.
