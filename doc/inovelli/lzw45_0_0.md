## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The LZW45 supports 4 association groups.

### Group 1: Group 1

Lifeline
Members of this group will receive unsolicited messages related to the status of the switch.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Group 2

Basic Set
Sends On & Off commands to associated devices. (1. Single press UP button sends BasicSet (0xFF) and 2. Single press Down sends BasicSet (0x00)

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Group 3

Switch Multilevel Set
Sends set level commands to associated devices when the up/down  button is pressed.

(1. Hold & Release Up or Down button sends SwitchMultiLevelSet which keeps associated devices in sync with this device. 2. Single press Up button sends SwitchMultiLevelSet(0xFF) and 4. Single press Down button sends SwitchMultiLevelSet(0x00)

Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 4: Group 4

Switch Multilevel Set
Sends start / stop level change to associated devices.

(1. Hold Up button sends SW\_MULTILEVEL\_START\_LEVEL\_CHANGE (Up)

2: Hold Down button sends SW\_MULTILEVEL\_START\_LEVEL\_CHANGE (Down) 3.
