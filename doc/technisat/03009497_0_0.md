## Overview

The TechniSat dimmer controls the brightness of a ceiling lamp, for instance, via the rockers. At the same time, the system can also be integrated into a Z-Wave Smart Home system in order to set dazzling lighting accents or to create a special mood with lighting. 

What's more, you can determine how much electricity you use and the dimmer can be integrated into complex schemes in smart home systems. 

The dimmer can be installed in standard flush-mounted boxes (DIN 49073-1)

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The 0300/9497 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
The lifeline group reports the device's status.
- Device Reset Locally Notification  
- Central Scene notification  
- Meter Report  
- Multilevel Switch Report  
- Notification Report

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Basic SET

Sends basic set commands to associated devices, according to the current state of the device.
Z-Wave devices control other Z-Wave devices. The relationship between one device controlling another device is called association. In order to control a different device, the controlling device needs to maintain a list of devices that will receive controlling commands. These lists are called association groups and they are always related to certain events (e.g. button pressed, sensor triggers, ...). In case the event happens all devices stored in the respective association group will receive the same wireless command wireless command, typically a 'Basic Set' Command.

Association group 2 supports 10 nodes.
