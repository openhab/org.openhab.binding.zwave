The Series switch 0300/9498 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

The TechniSat series switch lets you operate two ceiling lamps in a smart home system controlled by Z-Wave, for example. At the same time, the switch itself can still be switched on and off manually. 

What's more, you can determine how much electricity you use and the switch can be integrated into complex schemes in smart home systems. So it's perfect for providing more home comfort.

### Inclusion Information

  1. Install the TechniSat Wall Switch.
  2. After checking the correct installation, re-enable electrical power at the main fuse or circuit breaker.
  3. Start the Z-Wave device add mode on your Z-Wave gateway, according to the gateway‘s manual.
  4. Press T1 3x within 1 second.
  5. The red status LED is on while the device is added to the Z-Wave network.
  6. The green LED is on for 5 seconds after successfully adding the device.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The Series switch 0300/9498 supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
  * Device Reset Locally Notification
  * Central Scene notification
  * Meter Report
  * Switch Binary Report
  * Notification Report

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Switch State 1

  * Basic Set

Association group 2 supports 10 nodes.

### Group 3: Switch State 2

  * Basic Set

Association group 3 supports 10 nodes.
