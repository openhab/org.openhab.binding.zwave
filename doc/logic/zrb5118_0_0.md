The MATRIX ZRB5118 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

MATRIX type ZRB5118 wall switch is a unit with two relays and wireless Z-Wave communication that can be used to control other Z-Wave units, such as mufflers, curtain controls, other relay modules, etc.

MATRIX has two built-in relays can be used to control two local loads, e.g. a ceiling outlet, thereby replacing a standard 2-pole switch.

MATRIX contains four switches that make up the local operation. Each switch can freely control other Z-Wave devices, allowing you to control up to 4 external light zones. The devices in each light zone can be controlled with the commands 'ON', 'OFF' and 'DIM'.

The two relays can each be configured to belong to one of these 4 light zones, or they can be completely independent of the local operation (and thus only controlled via Z-Wave communication).

Furthermore, each switch can be used for operation individually or the control can be configured so that the contacts can work together in pairs, e.g. so that one switch is used to turn up the light and the other can turn down.

MATRIX allows the activation of scenes in the Z-Wave Controller (Command Class Central Scene).

MATRIX has a tangent front with four fields, where the field is backlit using 3-color LEDs, so-called RGB LEDs. The LEDs can combine the 3 basic colors and thereby form countless other colors. The light can be used as various function indications, such as orientation lights, control lights, etc. see the section on LEDs.

MATRIX is designed to fit in all FUGA compatible cans and substrates. The unit also fits in all FUGA compatible frame types and sizes.

In addition, MATRIX also acts as a Z-Wave repeater and will thereby extend the reach of the Z-Wave network.

### Inclusion Information

When MATRIX is delivered, the device does not belong to any Z-Wave network. 

To include the devince in the network using classic inclusion, start by putting the central network controller in inclusion mode. Please see in the manual of the network controller how to set the central controller is set in inclusion mode.

To activate inclusion / exclusion mode on the MATRIX unit, press the small button (i) once in the middle of the module (below the key cover), after which the LEDs in control button 1 will start flashing. Let the inclusion run until the LED stops blinking.

If the device already belongs to a network, then the device must be excluded before it can join another network, otherwise the registration process will fail.

### Exclusion Information

To start the exclusion process using classic mode, put the central network controller in exclusion mode. Please see in the manual of the network controller how to set the central controller is set in exclusion mode.

To activate inclusion / exclusion mode on the MATRIX unit, press the small button (i) once in the middle of the module (below the key cover), after which the LEDs in control button 1 will start flashing. Let the exclusion run until the LED stops blinking.

To reset the switch to factory settings press and hold the small button (i) for at least 10 seconds. When the button is release shortly after a small click is heard from the switch, and the reset has started.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The MATRIX ZRB5118 supports 15 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Lifeline. Sends Device Reset notifications, and Central Scene notifications
Entities in this group receive the Basic Report with the current status on buttons 1-4. This can be used by the Controller to update the user interface with the state of the contact.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Button 1 BASIC

Basic Report with the current state of button 1
