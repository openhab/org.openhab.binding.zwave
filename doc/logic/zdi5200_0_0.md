The Dimmy ZDI5200 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

DIMMY type ZDI5200 is a Z-Wave light dimmer with power metering, the module is designed to be installed in, for example, lamp outlets and thereby making the connected lamp dimmable through the Z-Wave network.

The DIMMY module can dim all kind of dimmable light sources from 0 - 250W.

The built-in power metering can measure the power consumption of the connected load as low as 2W and the metering data, both Watt and kWh, are reported to the Z-Wave Controller.

DIMMY is controlled via Z-Wave commands, for example by Logic Group MATRIX wall switches, and is able to send status-reports back to the switches and thereby be a part of a multi-way switching configuration, where several switches can control the DIMMY module and the switches receives reports about the actual status of the module.

DIMMY is also working as a repeater in the Z-Wave network and therefore expands the Z-Wave network coverage.

DIMMY is a single channel device, which means that all associations to DIMMY must be made as single channel associations.

### Inclusion Information

Add DIMMY to a network with Classic Inclusion by triple-pressing on the switch shaped as a power symbol (I) (Figure 4). The LED inside the module will start blinking.

If DIMMY already belongs to a Z-Wave network, the remove process must be performed before adding it in a new network. Otherwise, the adding of the device will fail.

### Exclusion Information

Remove DIMMY from a network by triple-pressing on the switch shaped as a power symbol (I) (Figure 4). The LED inside the module will start blinking.

## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 5 configuration parameters available in the Dimmy ZDI5200.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Duration of dimming | Duration of dimming |
| 2 | Dimmer mode | Dimmer mode |
| 3 | Dimmer minimum leve | Dimmer minimum leve |
| 4 | Dimmer maximum level. | Dimmer maximum level. |
| 5 | Meter report time. | Meter report time. |

### Parameter 1: Duration of dimming

Duration of dimming
This parameter specifies the duration of a full regulation of the light from 0% to 100%. A regulation of the light with 1% will take 1/100 of the specified duration. This is used when the dimming is fulfilled from other Z-Wave devices with a factory default duration.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The Dimmy ZDI5200 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Lifeline
Sends Device Reset notifications, Meter reports and Multilevel Switch reports.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Basic Report

Basic Report
Nodes in this group receives Basic Report with the actual state of the multilevel switch (dimmer). It can be used by MATRIX devices to update their internal pushbutton states and can be used in multi-way switching configurations for ensuring that all controlling devices has an updated status

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.
