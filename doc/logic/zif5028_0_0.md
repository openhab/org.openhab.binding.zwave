HeatIt Z-DIN 616 is re-branded Logic Group ZIF MODULE ZIF5028.

### Inclusion Information

Upon delivery, the Logic Group ZIF5028/Heatit Z-DIN 616 module has not been enrolled into any Z-Wave network. In order to communicate with other devices in the Z-Wave network, Logic Group ZIF5028/Heatit Z-DIN 616 must be enrolled in the network. This process is called to include the device in the Z-Wave network. Devices can also be removed from the Z-Wave network if they are to be used in another installation. This is called to exclude the device from the Z-Wave network.

Both processes are initiated by setting the central network controls in either inclusion or exclusion mode. Please refer to the network controller’s manual how to set the central controls in either inclusion or exclusion mode.

Then, the inclusion mode / exclusion mode on the Logic Group ZIF5028/Heatit Z-DIN 616 device is activated by pressing the small button through the hole in the front of the module, marked ”INCLUSION”, after which the status LED will start flashing.

IF THE DEVICE ALREADY BELONGS TO A NETWORK, THE DEVICE MUST BE EXCLUDED BEFORE IT CAN BE INCLUDED IN THE CURRENT NETWORK, OTHERWISE THE INCLUSION PROCESS WILL FAIL.

### Exclusion Information

The same as the inclusion. Put the Z-Wave controller into Exclusion mode and then press the small button through the hole in the front of the module, marked ”INCLUSION”, after which the status LED will start flashing.

FACTORY RESET

Logic Group ZIF5028/Heatit Z-DIN 616 can be reset to factory settings, i.e. all configurations and device address will be reset to default settings. The device must then be reconnected to the Z-Wave network.

Resetting is performed by activating the small pushbutton marked ”INCLUSION” located on the front for at least 10 seconds until the LED flashes briefly. E.g. slide a needle pin or a toothpick through the small hole to activate the pushbutton.

This procedure only applies to cases where the primary network controller is not available or not operational.

### General Usage Information

The Logic Group ZIF5028/Heatit Z-DIN 616, which is built upon the wireless Z-Wave communication protocol, has 6 relay driven outputs and 6 digital inputs. The unit is a multi-purpose Z-Wave I/O module, which can be used for many applications. E.g. Heatit Z-DIN 616 provides the possibility to control other systems via the Z-Wave network, by utilizing the 6 outputs as a kind of hand-over function to another automation system.

The relay outputs, which can be controlled from the Z-Wave network, is suitable for switching up to 6 pcs. 230Vac loads. In connection with simultaneous connection to SELV (Safety Extra Low Voltage) and 230Vac power circuits for relay outputs, relays must be considered as two groups, where the first group includes output 1 to 3 and the second group includes the outputs 4 to 6. This ensures complete separation between the SELV and 230Vac circuits. If one of the relays in the group is connected to a SELV circuit, the remaining outputs are not allowed to be connected to 230Vac or another circuit which is not a SELV circuit. For example, the relay outputs of the Heatit Z-DIN 616 module can be used to control the 230Vac power supply outlet, making it possible to turn on and disconnect the electrical outlets directly through the Z-Wave network. For safety reasons, however, it is recommended not to use the Heatit Z-DIN 616 to plug electrical outlets that are normally used for hazardous tools and machinery.

The 6 digital inputs of the Logic Group ZIF5028/Heatit Z-DIN 616 are useful for various purposes, where potential-free contacts, or Open Collector outputs, can be connected. The inputs can be configured to different trigger modes; leading edge, trailing edge or level triggered. The Logic Group ZIF5028/Heatit Z-DIN 616’s inputs can be programmed to control other Z-Wave devices when the inputs are activated, by sending Z-Wave commands over the Z-Wave network to e.g. Z-Wave relay modules, dimmer units etc. Logic Group ZIF5028/Heatit Z-DIN 616 allows sending different types of Z-Wave commands by utilizing the different association groups for the 6 inputs. In addition, the Logic Group ZIF5028/Heatit Z-DIN 616 also acts as a repeater, thus extending the range of the Z-Wave network. By default, the Logic Group ZIF5028/Heatit Z-DIN 616’s inputs and outputs are set to operate as toggle-relays. Input 1 controls the output 1, input 2 controls the output 2, etc. This functionality can be modified via the configuration parameters 3-8 and 13-18

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZIF5028 / HeatIt Z-DIN 616 supports 19 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
RELAY OUTPUT. Basic Report On/Off when relay output is activated.
Lifeline. Lifeline group for the entire module.  
Sends **Basic Report On / Off** when relay output 1 is activated.  
This group is typically used for reporting the actual status of the output to the Controller to let the Controller visualize the output in its user interface.

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Basic Set On / Off Input 1

Sends Basic Set On / Off when input 1 is activated.
Sends **Basic Set On / Off** when input 1 is activated.  
For example, used to control relay modules or for visualization in the central controller unit (e.g., Fibaro Home Center)

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Binary Switch Set On / Off Input 1

Sends Binary Switch Set On / Off when input 1 is activated.
Sends **Binary Switch Set On / Off** when input 1 is activated.

Sends Multilevel Switch Set / etc... when input 1 is activated.
Sends **Multilevel Switch Set / Multilevel Switch Start Level Change / Multilevel Switch Stop Level Change** when input 1 is activated.  
Typically used to control dimmers, curtain controls, etc.

Association group 4 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 5: Basic Set On / Off Input 2
