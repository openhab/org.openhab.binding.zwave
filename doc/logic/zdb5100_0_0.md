# ZDB5100 MATRIX Switch with Dimmer and Backlight
This describes the Z-Wave device *ZDB5100*, manufactured by *[Logic Group](http://www.logic-group.com)* with the thing type UID of ```logic_zdb5100_00_000```.

The device is in the category of *Wall Switch*, defining Any device attached to the wall that controls a binary status of something, for ex. a light switch.

The ZDB5100 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

MATRIX type ZDB5100 is a multifunction switch that can be mounted in a modular wall-box, with built-in light dimmer and four configurable pushbuttons with RGB indicators.

The built-in light dimmer is per default attached to pushbutton 1. This attachment can be configured, thus it can be configured to not be controlled by any the four pushbuttons, so it can be independent of the local operation and thereby only be controllable from the Z-Wave network.

Furthermore, the pushbuttons can be configured to work together in pairs; thereby it can be possible to have one pushbutton to dim the light up, and another pushbutton to dim the light down.

The four RGB indicators, one for each pushbutton, can be used for different purposes, for example as orientation light, status light, different kind of indications, etc. The colour of the light and the control of it is fully controllable from the Z-Wave network.

MATRIX is also working as a repeater for the Z-Wave network and therefore expands the Z-Wave network coverage.

### Inclusion Information

MATRIX’ add function is initiated by pressing once on the centre switch (I) (under the pushbutton cover). The LED’s in pushbutton 1 will start blinking. If MATRIX already belongs to a Z-Wave network, the remove process must be performed before adding it into a new network. Otherwise, the adding of the device will fail.

### Exclusion Information

MATRIX’ remove function is initiated by pressing once on the centre switch (I) (under the pushbutton cover). The LED’s in pushbutton 1 will start blinking.

**Factory Reset**

MATRIX can be factory reset by holding the centre switch (I) under the pushbutton cover, for at least 10 seconds. By following this procedure, all configuration parameters and the device network address will be reset back to the values they had when the device was manufactured.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZDB5100 supports 14 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Sends Device Reset notifications, and Central Scene notifications.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Basic Report, Pushbutton 1

Basic Report, Pushbutton 1
Nodes in this group also receive Basic Report with the actual state of pushbutton 1. It can be used by other MATRIX devices to update their internal pushbutton states. Normally the state is reported by the controlled device, but in cases where this is not possible, the MATRIX devices can get synchronised by reporting to each other.

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Binary Switch Report, Pushbutton 1

Binary Switch Report, Pushbutton 1
Nodes in this group receive Binary Switch Set commands when pushbutton 1 is operated. It can be used for controlling other Z-Wave devices, e.g. a relay module.

Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 4: Multi-Level Report, Pushbutton 1

Multi-Level Report, Pushbutton 1
Nodes in this group receive Multi-Level Switch Set / Multi-Level Switch Start Level Change / Multi-Level Switch Stop Level Change when pushbutton 1 is operated. It can, as an example, be used for controlling light dimmers.

Association group 4 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 5: Basic Report, Pushbutton 2

Nodes in this group also receives Basic Report with the actual state of pushbutton 2. It can be used by other MATRIX devices to update their internal pushbutton states. Normally the state is reported by the controlled device, but in cases where this is not possible, the MATRIX devices can get synchronised by reporting to each other.

Association group 5 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 6: Binary Switch Report, Pushbutton 2

Binary Switch Report, Pushbutton 2
Nodes in this group receives Binary Switch Set commands when pushbutton 2 is operated. It can be used for controlling other Z-Wave devices, e.g. a relay module.

Association group 6 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 7: Multi-Level Report, Pushbutton 2

Multi-Level Report, Pushbutton 2
Nodes in this group receives Multi-Level Switch Set / Multi-Level Switch Start Level Change / Multi-Level Switch Stop Level Change when pushbutton 2 is operated. It can, as an example, be used for controlling light dimmers.

Association group 7 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 8: Basic Report, Pushbutton 3

Basic Report, Pushbutton 3
Nodes in this group also receives Basic Report with the actual state of pushbutton 3. It can be used by other MATRIX devices to update their internal pushbutton states.

Association group 8 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 9: Binary Switch Report, Pushbutton 3

Binary Switch Report, Pushbutton 3
Nodes in this group receives Binary Switch Set commands when pushbutton 3 is operated. It can be used for controlling other Z-Wave devices, e.g. a relay module.

Multi-Level Report, Pushbutton 3
Nodes in this group receives Multi-Level Switch Set / Multi-Level Switch Start Level Change / Multi-Level Switch Stop Level Change when pushbutton 3 is operated. It can, as an example, be used for controlling light dimmers.

Association group 10 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 11: Basic Report, Pushbutton 4

Basic Report, Pushbutton 4
Nodes in this group also receives Basic Report with the actual state of pushbutton 4. It can be used by other MATRIX devices to update their internal pushbutton states. Normally the state is reported by the controlled device, but in cases where this is not possible, the MATRIX devices can get synchronised by reporting to each other.

Association group 11 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 12: Binary Switch Report, Pushbutton 4

Binary Switch Report, Pushbutton 4
Nodes in this group receives Binary Switch Set commands when pushbutton 4 is operated. It can be used for controlling other Z-Wave devices, e.g. a relay module.

Association group 12 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 13: Multi-Level Report, Pushbutton 4

Multi-Level Report, Pushbutton 4
Nodes in this group receives Multi-Level Switch Set / Multi-Level Switch Start Level Change / Multi-Level Switch Stop Level Change when pushbutton 4 is operated. It can, as an example, be used for controlling light dimmers.

### Group 14: Dimmer Basic Report

Dimmer Basic Report
Sends Basic Report with information about the actual level for the dimmer. This report is used by other MATRIX devices that are used for controlling this dimmer.

Association group 14 supports 5 nodes.
