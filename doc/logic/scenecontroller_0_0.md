The Heatit Z-Scene Controller does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

The Heatit Z-Wave Scene Controller is a Z-Wave module specifically adapted to Gira KNX touch sensors. The Heatit Z-Wave Scene Controller is a device with built-in wireless Z-Wave communication that may be used to control other Z-Wave devices such as dimmers, relay modules, etc.

The scene controller has a built-in relay that can be used to turn on and off a local load, e.g. a lamp, thus replacing a standard 1-pole switch.

### Inclusion Information

Pushing the upper left button 3 times (triple click) will activate Inclusion Mode on the device. It is also possible to activate Inclusion Mode by triple clicking the switch inside the module (through a little hole in the front of the module).

### Exclusion Information

The inclusion and exclusion of the device is confirmed by sending out a Node Information Frame. Beside this, it may be necessary for certain network operations to send out a Node Information Frame. Triple clicking the button inside the module through a little hole (normally covered by GIRA module) or the upper left button will issue a Node Information Frame.

### Wakeup Information

The Heatit Z-Scene Controller does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.
