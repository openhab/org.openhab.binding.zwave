# ZDB5400 MATRIX 55 Switch with Dimmer and Backlight
This describes the Z-Wave device *ZDB5400*, manufactured by *[Logic Group](http://www.logic-group.com)* with the thing type UID of ```logic_zdb5400_01_000```.
This version of the device is limited to firmware versions above 1.0

The device is in the category of *Wall Switch*, defining Any device attached to the wall that controls a binary status of something, for ex. a light switch.

The ZDB5400 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

MATRIX type ZDB5400 is a multifunction switch that can be mounted in a modular wall-box, with built-in light dimmer and four configurable pushbuttons with RGB indicators.

The pushbuttons can control other Z-Wave devices through the wireless Z-Wave network. The pushbuttons can send ’ON’, ’OFF’ and ’DIM’ commands to the associated Z-Wave devices. These devices could be other light dimmers, blinds, sun-screens, etc.

The built-in light dimmer is per default attached to pushbutton 1. This attachment can be configured, thus it can be configured to not be controlled by any the four pushbuttons, so it can be independent of the local operation and thereby only be controllable from the Z-Wave network.

Furthermore, the pushbuttons can be configured to work together in pairs; thereby it can be possible to have one pushbutton to dim the light up, and another pushbutton to dim the light down.

MATRIX can also issue scene activation commands that can be used to activate scenes in the Z-Wave Controller.

The four RGB indicators, one for each pushbutton, can be used for different purposes, for example as orientation light, status light, different kind of indications, etc. The colour of the light and the control of it is fully controllable from the Z-Wave network.

MATRIX 55 also works as a repeater for the Z-Wave network and therefore expands the Z-Wave network coverage.

### Inclusion Information

MATRIX’ add function is initiated by pressing once on the switch (I) (under the pushbutton cover). The LED inside the module will start blinking.  


If MATRIX already belongs to a Z-Wave network, the remove process must be performed before adding it into a new network. Otherwise, the adding of the device will fail.

MATRIX 55 can be factory reset by holding the switch through the hole (I) for at least 10 seconds.

### Exclusion Information

MATRIX’ remove function is initiated by pressing once on the switch (I) (under the pushbutton cover). The LED inside the module will start blinking.

1 Colour command sets the colour for OFF indication. (Default).

2 Colour command sets the colour for ON indication.
Values in the range 0 to 0 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_21_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 22: ON indication RGB-saturation for pushbutton 1

This parameter specifies the saturation levels when ON status is indicated
This parameter specifies the saturation levels for the red, green and blue LEDs, when ON status is indicated. (Default is the ON-state indicated by a 50% blue colour).

Byte 1: Colour saturation, red.  
0 - 255 Specifies the saturation for the red LEDs. (Default is 0)

Byte 2: Colour saturation, green.  
0 – 255 Specifies the saturation for the green LEDs. (Default is 0)

Byte 3: Colour saturation, blue.  
0 - 255 Specifies the saturation for the blue LEDs. (Default is 127)

Byte 4: LED control.  
0 - 255 LED indicator control; see the application note about this parameter.(Default is 0)
Values in the range 0 to 0 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_22_4``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 23: OFF indication RGB-saturation for pushbutton 1

This parameter specifies the saturation levels when OFF status is indicated
This parameter specifies the saturation levels for the red, green and blue LEDs, when OFF status is indicated. (Default is the OFF-state indicated as a low white light on 5%)

Byte 1: Colour saturation, red.  
0 - 255  Specifies the saturation for the red LEDs. (Default is 47).

Byte 2: Colour saturation, green.  
0 – 255  Specifies the saturation for the green LEDs. (Default is 47)

Byte 3: Colour saturation, blue.  
0 - 255  Specifies the saturation for the blue LEDs. (Default is 47)

Byte 4: LED control.  
0 - 255  LED indicator control; see the application note about this parameter. (Default is 0)
Values in the range 0 to 0 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_23_4``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZDB5400 supports 4 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Button 1 Basic Report


Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Button 1 Switch Binary Set


Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 4: Button 1 Switch Multilevel


Association group 4 supports 5 nodes.
