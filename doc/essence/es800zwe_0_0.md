The Z-Wave Plus Extender is assigned one of the following roles depending on the third-party controller capabilities:

  * **Secondary (inclusion)** - allowed to add or delete additional Z-Wave devices
  * **Secondary** –not allowed to add or delete additional Z-Wave devices

The ES800ZWE supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 3 nodes.
