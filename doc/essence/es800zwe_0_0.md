WeR@Home™ enters "learn" mode on the existing network to automatically copy the existing network's Smart Home network structure. When you join a Z-Wave network, you have access to the Z-Wave devices supported by WeR@Home™. The Z-Wave Plus Extender is assigned one of the following roles depending on the third-party controller capabilities:</p&gt <ul&gt<li&gt<strong&gtSecondary (inclusion)</strong&gt - allowed to add or delete additional Z-Wave devices</li&gt <li&gt<strong&gtSecondary</strong&gt –not allowed to add or delete additional Z-Wave devices</li&gt </ul&gt<p&gtTo join an existing third-party Z-Wave network:</p&gt <ol&gt<li&gtRemove all Z-Wave devices from your WeR@Home™, except for your Z-Wave Plus Extender.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the ES800ZWE -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|



## Device Configuration

The device has no configuration parameters defined.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ES800ZWE supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 3 nodes.
