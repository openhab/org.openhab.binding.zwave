The SHWM10000 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The SHWM10000 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

The SHWM10000 consists of a base unit (detector) and a water sensor (sensor), which are connected by a cable. If the sensor comes into contact with water, inform the detector the gateway and an alarm is triggered.

It detects sabotage when opening the case, has a battery-empty warning function and was designed for indoor installation.

### Inclusion Information

Within 3 seconds, press 3 times on the tamper button.

The status LED on the sensor front 3 x on. Repeat the inclusion process again if this was not successful.

### Exclusion Information

Within 3 seconds, press 3 times on the tamper button. The status LED on the sensor front 3 x on.

### Wakeup Information

The SHWM10000 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the SHWM10000 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Alarm (burglar) | alarm_burglar | alarm_burglar | Door | Switch | 
| Alarm (flood) | alarm_flood | alarm_flood | Water | Switch | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | system.battery_level | Battery | Number |

### Alarm (burglar)
Indicates if the burglar alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_burglar``` channel is of type ```alarm_burglar``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Door``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |

### Alarm (flood)
Indicates if the flood alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_flood``` channel is of type ```alarm_flood``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Water``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.


## Device Configuration

The device has no configuration parameters defined.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The SHWM10000 supports 5 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
The device sends a notification report of the command class battery report, notification report, and local device reset notification, binary report.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Group 2

Root-Device-Group (Binary Sensor)
Binary Sensor Command Class: Compatible with 300 Series

  * Sensor indicates the status of the open or closed door via lifeline.
  * When the sensor changes state between closedand door is opened, the device is triggered.

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Group 3

Root device group
Binary Sensor Command Class: Compatible with 300 Series

  * Sensor indicates the status, door sensor has been removed.
  * Device triggers when the sensor changes state tamper button detects.

Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 4: Group 4

Root device group (notification)
  * Notification Open or Closed Status via Lifeline
  * Device triggers when the sensor has a status change between closed and opened door recognizes.

Association group 4 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 5: Group 5

Root device group (notification)
  * Sensor reports the status door sensor has been removed.
  * The device triggers when the sensor changes state tamper button detects.

Association group 5 supports 5 nodes.
