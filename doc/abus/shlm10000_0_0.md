## Overview

The ABUS Z-Wave LED lamp can be an optical helper in many situations in your connected home. E.g. in case of danger, the escape routes can be perfectly illuminated by scene control. And if you are not at home, you can credibly simulate your presence by configuring scenarios. When it comes to comfort, you make no compromises compared to a 60W light bulb, with significantly lower power consumption. The LED lamp produces white light (2700k and 6500k), is dimmable and fits into any conventional E27 socket. You can change the light color.

### Inclusion Information

Screw the LED bulbinto a standard E27 socket. Click the + (Add) button in your Z-Wave App and follow the further instructions.

### Exclusion Information

Switch the Power supply of the LED bulb ON and OFF 6 times in a row (interval of 0.5 to 2 seconds)  
When switched on for the 7th time, the LED bulb flashes twice indicating successful reset to factory settings.

## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 1 configuration parameters available in the SHLM10000.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Temperature of NTC | This parameter can only be read and not set. |
|  | Switch All Mode | Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands |

### Parameter 1: Temperature of NTC

This parameter can only be read and not set.

Values in the range 0 to 255 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.
This is a read only parameter.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The SHLM10000 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 1 node.
