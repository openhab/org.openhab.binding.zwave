The PLBW10100 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The PLBW10100 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

Battery powered Motion detector (PIR) with integrated illuminance sensor (separate day/night report) and tamper protection.

### Inclusion Information

Within 1.5 seconds, press 3 times on the link-button.

### Exclusion Information

Within 1.5 seconds, press 3 times on the link-button.

### Wakeup Information

The PLBW10100 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The PLBW10100 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Notification Report; Battery Report; Device Reset Locally Notification; Sensor Multilevel Report
The Lifeline Association is automatically established between the Z-Wave controller and the device during inclusion and defines what information is exchanged between the Z-Wave controller and the device.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: On/Off Control

Basic Set;
When the motion alarm is triggered, it sends a BASIC SET On / Off command to the nodes of group 2

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.
