## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 4 configuration parameters available in the XL624.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 10 | Minimum Off Time | Minimum Off Time |
| 11 | Minimum Run Time | Minimum Run Time |
| 12 | Heating Delta Stage 1 ON | Heating Delta Stage 1 ON |
| 13 | Heating Delta Stage 1 OFF | Heating Delta Stage 1 OFF |

### Parameter 10: Minimum Off Time

Minimum Off Time
Sets the minimum off time before another heating/cooling cycle can begin to provide compressor short cycle protection. The thermostat screen will display WAIT when minimum off time is being enforced.This is an advanced parameter and will therefore not show in the user interface without entering advanced mode.
Values in the range 5 to 9 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```5```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_10_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 11: Minimum Run Time

Minimum Run Time
Sets the minimum run time before a heating/cooling cycle can turn off to prevent rapid cycling. Thermostat screen will display "Cool ON" or "Heat ON" while the minimum run time is being enforced.This is an advanced parameter and will therefore not show in the user interface without entering advanced mode.
Values in the range 1 to 9 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```6```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_11_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 12: Heating Delta Stage 1 ON

Heating Delta Stage 1 ON
Sets the delta from setpoint that stage 1 heating starts.This is an advanced parameter and will therefore not show in the user interface without entering advanced mode.
Values in the range 1 to 8 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_12_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 13: Heating Delta Stage 1 OFF

Heating Delta Stage 1 OFF
Sets the delta from setpoint that stage 1 heating stops. Stage 1 turns off at setpoint minus (-) Delta Stage 1.This is an advanced parameter and will therefore not show in the user interface without entering advanced mode.
Values in the range 0 to 8 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_13_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The device does not support associations.
