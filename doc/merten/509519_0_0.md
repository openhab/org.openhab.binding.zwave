The 509519 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

Movement/presence detectors switch on as soon as they detect a moving heat source. This can be a person, but also animals, trees, cars or differences in temperature in windows. In order to avoid false alarms, the chosen installation site should be such that undesired heat sources cannot be detected (see section „Selecting the installation site“). 

### Inclusion Information

Turn the controller A on the ARGUS to position B: The learning mode is activated. 

### Exclusion Information

Turn the controller A on the ARGUS to position B: The learning mode is activated.

| Binary Sensor 4 | sensor_binary4 | sensor_binary |  | Switch | 
| Sensor (luminance) 4 | sensor_luminance4 | sensor_luminance |  | Number | 

### Switch
Switch the power on and off.

The ```switch_binary``` channel is of type ```switch_binary``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Switch``` category.

### Switch 1
Switch the power on and off.

The ```switch_binary1``` channel is of type ```switch_binary``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Switch``` category.

### Switch 2
Switch the power on and off.

The ```switch_binary2``` channel is of type ```switch_binary``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Switch``` category.

### Binary Sensor 3
Indicates if a sensor has triggered.

The ```sensor_binary3``` channel is of type ```sensor_binary``` and supports the ```Switch``` item. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| ON | Triggered |
| OFF | Untriggered |

### Sensor (general) 3


The ```sensor_general3``` channel is of type ```sensor_general``` and supports the ```Number``` item. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Binary Sensor 4
Indicates if a sensor has triggered.

The ```sensor_binary4``` channel is of type ```sensor_binary``` and supports the ```Switch``` item. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| ON | Triggered |
| OFF | Untriggered |

### Sensor (luminance) 4
Indicates the current light reading.

The ```sensor_luminance4``` channel is of type ```sensor_luminance``` and supports the ```Number``` item. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.



## Device Configuration

The device has no configuration parameters defined.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The 509519 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Master (Light Control)

Master

Association group 1 supports 4 nodes.

### Group 2: Report (Status Report)

Report

Association group 2 supports 4 nodes.
