The MTN5051 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

Remote Control for RF system CONNECT.The device-specific addressing of the radio commands also enables multiple radio systems to operate side by side.

### Inclusion Information

Press and hold the [Z] key + press the [Conf] key 3 times: the status LED flashes orange and then continuously lights up green

### Exclusion Information

  * Press the [Z] key.
  * Press and hold the [Conf] and [Remove] keys for at least 3 s: the LED flashes orange.
  * Enter the 4-digit code 8761: The LED first quickly flashes orange and then goes out:

### Wakeup Information

The MTN5051 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Switch All Mode

Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands.

The following option values may be configured -:
| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Exclude from All On and All Off groups |
| 1 | Include in All On group |
| 2 | Include in All Off group |
| 255 | Include in All On and All Off groups |

This parameter has the configuration ID ```switchall_mode``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The MTN5051 supports 12 association groups.

### Group 1: Group 1


Association group 1 supports 10 nodes.

### Group 2: Group 2


Association group 2 supports 10 nodes.

### Group 3: Group 3

Association group 4 supports 10 nodes.

### Group 5: Group 5


Association group 5 supports 10 nodes.

### Group 6: Group 6


Association group 6 supports 10 nodes.

### Group 7: Group 7


Association group 7 supports 10 nodes.

### Group 8: Group 8
