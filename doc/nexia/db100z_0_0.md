## Overview

No device information is provided in the database. Consider [updating the database](http://www.cd-jackson.com/index.php/zwave/zwave-device-database/zwave-device-list/devicesummary/309) to improve the documentation.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the DB100Z

| Channel | Channel Id | Category | Item Type |
|---------|------------|----------|-----------|
| Power Management Notification | notification_power_management |  | Number | 
| battery-level | system.battery-level | Battery | Number |

### Power Management Notification

Power Management

The ```notification_power_management``` channel supports the ```Number``` item. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Number``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| 0 | Previous events cleared |
| 1 | Power has been applied |
| 2 | AC mains disconnected |
| 3 | AC mains re-connected |
| 4 | Surge detected |
| 5 | Voltage Drop/Drift |
| 6 | Over-current detected |
| 7 | Over-voltage detected |
| 8 | Over-load detected |
| 9 | Load error |
| 10 | Replace battery soon |
| 11 | Replace battery now |
| 12 | Battery is charging |
| 13 | Battery is fully charged |
| 14 | Charge battery soon |
| 15 | Charge battery now! |

### Battery Level

Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.



## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 1 configuration parameters available in the DB100Z.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Send Battery Report with Notification Report | Send Battery Report with Notification Report |
|  | Wakeup Interval | Sets the interval at which the device will accept commands from the controller |
|  | Wakeup Node | Sets the node ID of the device to receive the wakeup notifications |

### Parameter 1: Send Battery Report with Notification Report

Send Battery Report with Notification Report

The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Do not send battery report |
| 1 | Send Battery Report |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Do not send battery report).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The DB100Z supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline


This group supports 5 nodes.
