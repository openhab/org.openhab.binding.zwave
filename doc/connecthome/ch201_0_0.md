The CH-201 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

The CH-201 thermostat is a Z-Wave device designed to maintain the set temperature. The thermostat can control the heating element directly (electric floor heating, electric heater, etc.) or with additional equipment (thermoelectric drive, etc.) The thermostat is equipped with a digital temperature sensor, but can work with any other temperature sensor if necessary.

### Inclusion Information

To include the thermostat in a Z-Wave network, place the controller in the inclusion mode (see the instructions of your controller) and apply power to the electrical network to which the device is connected. The device will be added automatically (NWI). If this does not happen automatically, briefly press the system button three times on the top cover of the device.

If there are problems with connecting the device to your Z-Wave network, you must complete the Z-Wave network exclusion procedure, and then repeat the inclusion procedure.

### Exclusion Information

To exclude the thermostat from the Z-Wave network, place the controller in the exclusion mode (see the controller instruction) and press the system button three times briefly.

**Please note that after excluding the device from the Z-Wave network, all settings you have made will be reset to the factory settings.**

### Parameter 1: Relay mode



The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Normal |
| 1 | Reverse |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Normal).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Temperature threshold

Set temperature threshold
**Unfortunately, it is not possible to always maintain one exact temperature value because of inertia.**

To maintain the temperature, two values ​​are used: minimum and maximum. When the minimum value is reached, the heating will be turned on, when heating to the maximum value - the heating element will be turned off. For the convenience of the user, the controller assumes temperature adjustment with only one value, from which the thermostat will calculate the previously mentioned "minimum" and "maximum" values ​​of the temperature range. We recommend using a small range of 1 degree for more comfort and the most accurate match to the chosen temperature. If your heating element consumes a significant amount of energy at the moment of switching on, then it is recommended to reduce the number of on-off cycles by increasing this parameter. With our thermostat, you can always achieve the optimum operating mode by experiment or by contacting our specialists for help. The acceptable value is from 1 to 7 degrees:
Values in the range 1 to 7 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1```.

### Parameter 10: Temperature sensor mode

Set temperature sensor mode
The CH-201 thermostat is equipped with a high-precision temperature sensor CH-S01. If in your Z-Wave network configuration it is more convenient to use a remote Z-Wave temperature sensor - you need to change this parameter.

Remote Z-Wave temperature sensor is any temperature sensor of your Z-Wave network. It can be either a separate device or as part of another device.

Remote sensor operating modes:

the thermostat can request a temperature at the room sensor (in case of a data request, the room sensor must be added to the 2nd group of thermostat connections). For the correct operation of the device, it is necessary that there is only one temperature sensor in the link group.

The thermostat can wait for temperature data from the room sensor. To do this, add the thermostat to the corresponding group of the room sensor connections, which receives the temperature data (see the sensor instruction).

**Take into account the fact that until the temperature is reached, the thermostat will go into the crash mode and will be in it until the temperature data are obtained.**

0 Standard temperature sensor (Default);

1 Polling the room temperature sensor;

2 Waiting for data from the room temperature sensor.
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Standard temperature sensor |
| 1 | Polling the room temperature sensor |
| 2 | Waiting for data from the room temperature sensor |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Standard temperature sensor).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_10_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 11: Polling period of the room sensor

Set polling period of the room sensor
If you select a value, you should take into account the fact that too frequent polling of the sensor can overload the Z-Wave network

Valid value is from 15 to 600 seconds:

300 seconds (Default).
Values in the range 15 to 600 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```300```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_11_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 12: Temprature threshold to send data

The value that temprature should be changed to send data
The value that temprature should be changed to send data to devices in the 1st group of connections recieved from a temprature sensor

The thermostat can send data to the controller and / or other Z-Wave network devices when the temperature changes by the specified value. Set this parameter based on your network configuration to avoid overloading.

The valid value is from 1 to 16 degrees:

1 degree (Default).
Values in the range 1 to 16 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_12_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 13: Interval for forced sending data

Set Interval for forced sending data
Interval for forced sending data to devices in 1st group of connections recieved from a temprature sensor.

The thermostat can send data at regular intervals, for example every 2 minutes. The value begins to count from the last successful sending of data.

The valid value is from 10 to 600 seconds:

300 seconds (Default).
Values in the range 100 to 600 may be set.

1. Bistable: for conventional switches with two fixed positions Enabled and Disabled.

2. Bistable, fixed position 2 (contacts on the switch are open - on, closed - off). It is necessary to take into account the fact that when the module receives a command from another device Z-Wave network the thermostat will change its state and to control the button, it must first be returned to the corresponding state;

3. Bistable, each subsequent keystroke will change the status of the relay.
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Monostable |
| 1 | Bistable, fixed position 1 |
| 2 | Bistable, fixed position 2 |
| 3 | Bistable |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Send the actual temperature (further t);).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_40_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The CH-201 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Target for temperature and alarm reports

A group of devices that receive temperature reports and an alarm in the event of a sensor shutdown. This group can have up to 10 devices with a controller in mind, which is recommended to be included in this group.

Association group 1 supports 10 nodes.

### Group 2: External temperature sensor

In case if **Parameter 10** is set to **1 Polling the room temperature sensor, **the temperature value used by the thermostat to control heating device will be reqested from the sensor added to this group. Only one device can be added.

Association group 2 supports 1 node.
