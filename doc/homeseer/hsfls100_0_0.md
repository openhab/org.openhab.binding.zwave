The HS-FLS100+ supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

The HS-FLS100+ is a PIR module that’s designed to retrofit onto existing outdoor floodlights. It features a PIR sensor to detect motion through movement of heat sources and a LUX sensor for determining brightness of its surroundings. It is equipped with Z-Wave Plus wireless communication capability that will convert an ordinary motion-activated floodlight into a smart home device.

**Conventional Floodlight Mode** HS-FLS100+ can be used as a conventional motion-activated floodlight sensor to power floodlights when motion is sensed during dark hours. Controls are provided for manual adjustment of LUX sensitivity and floodlight ON times.

**Smart Floodlight Mode** When added to a smart home system, HS-FLS100+ will send Z-Wave commands to the smart hub or home controller when motion is sensed and when the LUX level changes. Likewise, the smart hub or home controller can send Z-Wave commands back to the HS-FLS100+ to turn floodlights ON and OFF. This added functionality provides a very high level of flexibility not typically available in conventional motion-activated floodlights.

**Smart Sensor Mode** HS-FLS100+ can be installed and used simply as an outdoor motion and LUX sensor. Floodlight functionality is not required. This provides some interesting security and smart home possibilities!

### PIR Trigger Off period
Range: 8~720 secs

Default: 15

Generic class for configuration parameter.

The ```config_decimal``` channel is of type ```config_decimal``` and supports the ```Number``` item.

### Lux sensor threshold
Factory default at 50

Setting = 0: always don’t turn ON light

Setting = 30~200: lighting activation by setting

Setting = 255: turn ON light upon PIR triggered

Generic class for configuration parameter.

The ```config_decimal``` channel is of type ```config_decimal``` and supports the ```Number``` item.

### Auto Report luminance interval
Default: 10

Setting: 0~1440 (min.)

Generic class for configuration parameter.

The ```config_decimal``` channel is of type ```config_decimal``` and supports the ```Number``` item.

### Alarm (power)
Indicates if a power alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_power``` channel is of type ```alarm_power``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |

### Motion Alarm
Indicates if a motion alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_motion``` channel is of type ```alarm_motion``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Motion``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 4 configuration parameters available in the HS-FLS100+.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | PIR Trigger Off Period | Period to send Trigger Off command after PIR is triggered. |
| 2 | Lux sensor threshold | Lux level to activate the PIR |
| 3 |  Auto Report luminance interval | sets the interval of periodic lux level report to the controller |
| 4 | Basic Report |  |

### Parameter 1: PIR Trigger Off Period

Period to send Trigger Off command after PIR is triggered.
Period to send Trigger Off command after PIR is triggered. Before this period expires, the PIR will not be able to detect any subsequent motion.
Values in the range 8 to 720 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```15```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Lux sensor threshold

Lux level to activate the PIR
When the lux level falls below this threshold and the PIR gets triggered, the unit emits a Basic Set Command (Value=0xFF) and turns on its floodlight. This overwrites the Lux level set by the Lux knob.

Setting = 0: always don’t turn ON light

Setting = 30~200: lighting activation by setting

Setting = 255: turn ON light upon PIR triggered

If the level is set to 0, the unit will not turn on its floodlight. The PIR will still send a notification report to the controller; if the level is set to 255, when motion is sensed, the sensor ignore the ambient brightness but just turn on the light.
Values in the range 0 to 255 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```50```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3:  Auto Report luminance interval

sets the interval of periodic lux level report to the controller

Values in the range 0 to 1440 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```10```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 4: Basic Report



The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | not send Basic Report |
| 1 | send Basic Report |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (send Basic Report).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_4_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The HS-FLS100+ supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Device Reset Locally Notification

Notification Report 

Binary Report 

Sensor Multilevel Report 

Basic Report

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: PIR Control

Devices in the group are controlled by the PIR sensor
Basic Set

Association group 2 supports 4 nodes.
