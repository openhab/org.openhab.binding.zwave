The HS-FLS100-G2 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

  


The HS-FLS100-G2 is a PIR module that’s designed to retrofit onto existing outdoor floodlights. It features a PIR sensor to detect motion through movement of heat sources and a LUX sensor for determining brightness of its surroundings. It is equipped with Z-Wave Plus wireless communication capability that will convert an ordinary motion-activated floodlight into a smart home device.

**Conventional Floodlight Mode** HS-FLS100-G2 can be used as a conventional motion-activated floodlight sensor to power floodlights when motion is sensed during dark hours. Controls are provided for manual adjustment of LUX sensitivity and floodlight ON times.

**Smart Floodlight Mode** When added to a smart home system, HS-FLS100-G2 will send Z-Wave commands to the smart hub or home controller when motion is sensed and when the LUX level changes. Likewise, the smart hub or home controller can send Z-Wave commands back to the HS-FLS100-G2 to turn floodlights ON and OFF. This added functionality provides a very high level of flexibility not typically available in conventional motion-activated floodlights.

**Smart Sensor Mode** HS-FLS100-G2 can be installed and used simply as an outdoor motion and LUX sensor. Floodlight functionality is not required. This provides some interesting security and smart home possibilities!

**S2 Security**

This product supports the S2 security protocol that uses encrypted Z-Wave Plus messages to communicate to other security-enabled Z-Wave Plus products. A security-enabled Z-Wave Plus controller must be used in order to fully utilize the security features of this product.

## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 8 configuration parameters available in the HS-FLS100-G2.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | PIR Trigger Off Period | Period to send Trigger Off command after PIR is triggered. |
| 2 | Lux sensor threshold | Lux level to activate the PIR |
| 3 |  Auto Report luminance interval | sets the interval of periodic lux level report and temperature report to the controller |
| 4 | PIR Trigger alert | Enable/Disables PIR alerts sent from the unit through Notification report or Basic Report commands |
| 5 | Floodlight Control Mode | Enable/Disables Floodlight control by Zwave and/or PIR trigger and LUX level |
| 6 | Lux Sensor | Enable/Disables floodlight is controlled by LUX Level and PIR trigger or LUX level only |
| 7 | Measured Temperature Offset | Sets the offset to the Measured Temperature |
| 8 | PIR Sensitivity Level | Sets the PIR Sensitivity Level |

### Parameter 1: PIR Trigger Off Period

Period to send Trigger Off command after PIR is triggered.
Period to send Trigger Off command after PIR is triggered. Before this period expires, the PIR will not be able to detect any subsequent motion.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The HS-FLS100-G2 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Device Reset Locally Notification

Notification Report 

Binary Report 

Sensor Multilevel Report 

Basic Report

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: PIR Control

Devices in the group are controlled by the PIR sensor
Basic Set

Association group 2 supports 4 nodes.
