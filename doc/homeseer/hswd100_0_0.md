The HS-WD100+ supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

HS-WD100+ is a Z-Wave wall dimmer that’s designed for wireless on-off-dim control of connected dimmable lighting loads. 

### Inclusion Information

Tap the paddle of your new HomeSeer switch to begin the inclusion process. This will take a few moments to complete. 

### Exclusion Information

Single click and release the rocker switch. 

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the HS-WD100+ -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Dimmer | switch_dimmer | switch_dimmer | DimmableLight | Dimmer | 
| Scene Number | scene_number | scene_number |  | Number | 

### Dimmer
The brightness channel allows to control the brightness of a light.
            It is also possible to switch the light on and off.

The ```switch_dimmer``` channel is of type ```switch_dimmer``` and supports the ```Dimmer``` item and is in the ```DimmableLight``` category.

### Scene Number
Triggers when a scene button is pressed.

The ```scene_number``` channel is of type ```scene_number``` and supports the ```Number``` item.
This channel provides the scene, and the event as a decimal value in the form ```<scene>.<event>```. The scene number is set by the device, and the event is as follows -:

| Event ID | Event Description  |
|----------|--------------------|
| 0        | Single key press   |
| 1        | Key released       |
| 2        | Key held down      |
| 3        | Double keypress    |
| 4        | Tripple keypress   |
| 5        | 4 x keypress       |
| 6        | 5 x keypress       |



## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 5 configuration parameters available in the HS-WD100+.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 4 | Orientation | Controls the on/off orientation of the rocker switch |
| 7 | Remote Dimming Level Increment | Number of levels (1-99) to change dimming each step when controlled remotely |
| 8 | Remote Dimming Step Duration | Time interval (in tens of ms) of brightness change when controlled remotely |
| 9 | Local Dimming Level Increment | Number of levels (1-99) to change dimming each step when controlled locally |
| 10 | Local Dimming Step Duration | Time interval (in tens of ms) of brightness change when controlled locally |
|  | Switch All Mode | Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands |

### Parameter 4: Orientation

Controls the on/off orientation of the rocker switch

The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Normal |
| 1 | Inverted |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Normal).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_4_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 7: Remote Dimming Level Increment

Number of levels (1-99) to change dimming each step when controlled remotely
This is the step value that the dimmer level is incremented or decremented for each step duration when controlled remotely.

(This parameter was added in firmware version 5.14)
Values in the range 1 to 99 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_7_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 8: Remote Dimming Step Duration

Time interval (in tens of ms) of brightness change when controlled remotely
Select time interval to move to the next brightness level. The larger the number, the slower the adjustment to dim levels. 

(This parameter was added in firmware version 5.14)
Values in the range 1 to 255 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```3```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_8_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 9: Local Dimming Level Increment

Number of levels (1-99) to change dimming each step when controlled locally
This is the step value that the dimmer level is incremented or decremented for each step duration when controlled locally.
Values in the range 1 to 99 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_9_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 10: Local Dimming Step Duration

Time interval (in tens of ms) of brightness change when controlled locally
Select time interval to move to the next brightness level. The larger the number, the slower the adjustment to dim levels. 
Values in the range 1 to 255 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```3```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_10_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Switch All Mode

Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands.

The following option values may be configured -:
| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Exclude from All On and All Off groups |
| 1 | Include in All On group |
| 2 | Include in All Off group |
| 255 | Include in All On and All Off groups |

This parameter has the configuration ID ```switchall_mode``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The HS-WD100+ supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Lifeline association only supports the "manual reset" event.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.
