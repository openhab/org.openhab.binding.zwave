The HS-WV100+ supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

HS-WV100+ is a valve controller system that is designed to control the flow of water when Z-Wave commands are received. It may be used with compatible home automation systems (and sensors) to mitigate water damage when leaks are detected. It may also be used for a variety of other automated or remotely controlled water or irrigation needs. 

### Inclusion Information

  1. Put your home automation controller into ‘inclusion’ mode. Consult your system’s manual for details.
  2. Press the “program” button on the water valve controller unit. Wait for the process to finish.

### Exclusion Information

  1. Put your home automation controller into ‘exclusion’ mode. Consult your system’s manual for details.
  2. Press the “program” button on the water valve controller unit. Wait for the process to finish

### General Usage Information

# OPERATION

## Remote Valve Operation (use this procedure for remote or automatic control of the water valve)

HS-WV100+ valve controller behaves like a Z-Wave “binary” device, with “ON” and “OFF” values, when added to most home automation systems.

  * Open Valve - Issue “ON” command from Z-Wave controller or Z-Wave compatible home automation system.
  * Close Valve - Issue “OFF” command from Z-Wave controller or Z-Wave compatible home automation system.

## Local Valve Operation (use this procedure for convenient local control of the water valve)

  * Open Valve - Press and release the ’Open’ button on the water valve controller unit to open the water valve.
  * Close Valve - Press and release the ’Close’ button on the water valve controller unit to close the water valve.

## Local Manual Valve Operation (for use in the event of a power failure or water valve controller failure)

  * Open Valve - Pull the thumbwheel on the water valve housing up and rotate wheel counter-clockwise.
  * Close Valve - Pull the thumbwheel on the water valve housing up and rotate wheel clockwise.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the HS-WV100+ -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Switch | switch_binary | switch_binary | Switch | Switch | 
| Alarm (system) | alarm_system | alarm_system |  | Switch | 

### Switch
Switch the power on and off.

The ```switch_binary``` channel is of type ```switch_binary``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Switch``` category.

### Alarm (system)
Indicates if a system alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_system``` channel is of type ```alarm_system``` and supports the ```Switch``` item. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |



## Device Configuration

The device has no configuration parameters defined.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The HS-WV100+ supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 4 nodes.
