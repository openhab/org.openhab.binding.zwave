The HS-M200 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

The HSM200 is designed to sense motion, temperature and light levels and will work with most Z-Wave certified controllers or smart hubs. HomeSeer HS4 system users can also program the unit to display up to 7 different colors when things happen in the home. Since the HSM200 is line powered, it can function as a Z-Wave network repeater and there are no batteries to replace!

### Inclusion Information

Adding the HSM200 to your Z-Wave Network 

a) The HSM200 is Z-Wave certified multi-sensor that should work with any Z-Wave certified system controller. Please follow the procedure required by your controller manufacturer for including the HSM200 with your Z-Wave network.

b) Once that is started, press the button on the side of the HSM200 once to activate inclusion.

### Dimmer
The brightness channel allows to control the brightness of a light.
            It is also possible to switch the light on and off.

The ```switch_dimmer``` channel is of type ```switch_dimmer``` and supports the ```Dimmer``` item and is in the ```DimmableLight``` category.

### Sensor (luminance)
Indicates the current light reading.

The ```sensor_luminance``` channel is of type ```sensor_luminance``` and supports the ```Number``` item. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Sensor (temperature)
Indicates the current temperature.

The ```sensor_temperature``` channel is of type ```sensor_temperature``` and supports the ```Number:Temperature``` item and is in the ```Temperature``` category.

### Color Control
The color channel allows to control the color of a light.
            It is also possible to dim values and switch the light on and off.

The ```color_color``` channel is of type ```color_color``` and supports the ```Color``` item and is in the ```ColorLight``` category.

### Color Temperature
The color temperature channel allows to set the color
            temperature of a light from 0 (cold) to 100 (warm).

The ```color_temperature``` channel is of type ```color_temperature``` and supports the ```Dimmer``` item and is in the ```ColorLight``` category.

### Alarm (burglar)
Indicates if the burglar alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_burglar``` channel is of type ```alarm_burglar``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Door``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |



## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 4 configuration parameters available in the HS-M200.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | On time | minutes that the lights stay on when motion has not been detected. |
| 2 | On Level | value sent to Group 2 when motion is detected |
| 3 | Luminance Report | Luminance report interval |
| 4 | Temperature Report | Temperature Report interval |

### Parameter 1: On time

minutes that the lights stay on when motion has not been detected.
On Time sets the number of minutes that the lights stay on when motion has not been detected.

A value of 0 On Time is a special mode where the lights are constantly sent a command to turn them on whenever motion is detected. The device will NOT turn the lights off in this mode. Note that this mode will significantly shorten battery life.

Recommended values:

5 min for hallways.

20 min for an office environment.

60 min for a library or other room where someone may be sitting still for a long time.
Values in the range 0 to 255 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```3```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: On Level

value sent to Group 2 when motion is detected
A value of 0 will turn the lights off (not recommended).

A value between 1 and 99 will set the dim level to between 1% and 99% (99% is full on).

A value of -1 will turn the light on which depends on the device but most will set the dim level to the last dim setting.
Values in the range -1 to 99 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```99```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: Luminance Report

Luminance report interval
A Luminance report is sent to the system controller every LiteMin minutes.

A value of zero turns this mode off. Luminance values can still be obtained at any time by the home control application in this mode.
Values in the range 0 to 0 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 4: Temperature Report

Temperature Report interval
A value of zero turns this mode off. Temperature values can still be obtained at any time by polling the status of the temperature sensor.
Values in the range 0 to 255 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```5```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_4_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The HS-M200 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: BASIC ON

This group is used to directly turn lights on or off when motion is detected. Up to four (4) Z-Wave devices can be associated in this group. The HSM200 will send a BASIC ON command to all devices that are associated in this group. Note that the Z-Wave devices in this group must be within direct range (about 30’) of the HSM200. Control of nodes that are further away or blocked by metal or concrete walls should rely on the Z-Wave system controller and the home-control application for reliable operation.

Association group 2 supports 4 nodes.
