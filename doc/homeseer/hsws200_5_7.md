The HS-WS200+ supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

HS-WS200+ is a Z-Wave Plus relay (on-off) wall switch for use with most lighting and appliance loads. The switch includes an RBG LED indicator which may be controlled wirelessly to suit color preferences or to reflect the changing status of other devices in your home. HS-WS200+ is also designed to trigger automation events with a multi-tap operation (up to 5 taps).

### Inclusion Information

Tap the paddle of your HomeSeer switch to begin the inclusion process. This will take a few moments to complete.

### Exclusion Information

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The HS-WS200+ supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Lifeline association only supports the "manual reset" event.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.
