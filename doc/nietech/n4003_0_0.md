The n4003 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

  


This product can be included and operated in any Z-Wave network with other Z-Wave certified devices from other manufacturers and/or other applications. All non-battery operated nodes within the network will act as repeaters regardless of vendor to increase the reliability of the network. This Device supports Lifeline (association group 1) supporting 1 node for lifeline communication.

Group 1 must be assigned the Node ID of the primary controller where unsolicited notifications will be sent. The Z-Wave controller should set this association automatically after inclusion.

Lifeline association only supports the "Device Reset Locally" function.

### Inclusion Information

  


Once the controller is ready to add your device, press the Manual/Program button on the smart plug 3 times quickly. The blue LED will blink quickly. Auto-add mode: LED will blink within 30 seconds after first plugged in. Now, you have complete control to turn your fixture ON/OFF according to groups, schedules and interactive automation programmed by your controller. If your Z-Wave certified controller features remote access, you can control your fixture from your mobile devices.  


If you have issues with pairing/including, please move the device as close as possible to the hub and try again--you can move to your final location when completed.

Note: If the manual button doesn't light up after pressed 3 times, please reset the device: click the button 2 times quickly then hold for at least 10 seconds. This operation could be done when manual control is functional--single press can turn on/off the lamp.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The n4003 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Lifeline

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Basic Set

Basic Set
hen the output of the N4003 socket is changed, On (0xFF) or Off (0x00). The N4003 will automatically send out a relatedÂ basic On (0xFF) or Off (0x00) to this group

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.
