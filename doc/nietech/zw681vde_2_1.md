The ZW681 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

This plug-in ON/OFF Module in a transceiver which is a Z-Wave enabled device and is fully compatible with any Z-Wave enabled network. Z-Wave enabled devices displaying the Z-Wave plus logo can also be used with it regardless of the manufacturer, and ours can also be used in other manufacturer's Z-Wave enabled networks. Remote on/off control of the connected load is possible with other manufacturer's Wireless Controller. Each module is designed to act as a repeater. Repeaters will re-transmit the RF signal to ensure that the signal is received by its intended destination by routing the signal around obstacles and radio dead spots.

### Inclusion Information

For “Add” in a network: Put the Z-wave interface controller into “Add” mode, and following its instruction to add the ZW861VDE to your controller. To get in the “Add” mode, the distance between ZW681VDE and controller is suggested to be in one meter. Quickly pressing the learn switch of ZW861VDE three times to be included.

### Exclusion Information

For “Remove” from a network: set up the Z-wave interface controller into “Remove” mode, and following its instruction to delete the ZW861VDE from your controller. Quickly press the learn switch of ZW861VDE three times to be excluded

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the ZW681 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Switch | switch_binary | switch_binary | Switch | Switch | 
| Electric meter (volts) | meter_voltage | meter_voltage | Energy | Number | 
| Electric meter (kWh) | meter_kwh | meter_kwh | Energy | Number | 
| Electric meter (watts) | meter_watts | meter_watts | Energy | Number | 
| Electric meter (amps) | meter_current | meter_current | Energy | Number | 
| Alarm (power) | alarm_power | alarm_power | Energy | Switch | 

### Switch
Switch the power on and off.

The ```switch_binary``` channel is of type ```switch_binary``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Switch``` category.

### Electric meter (volts)
Indicates the instantaneous voltage.

The ```meter_voltage``` channel is of type ```meter_voltage``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Electric meter (kWh)
Indicates the energy consumption (kWh).

The ```meter_kwh``` channel is of type ```meter_kwh``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Electric meter (watts)
Indicates the instantaneous power consumption.

The ```meter_watts``` channel is of type ```meter_watts``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Electric meter (amps)
Indicates the instantaneous current consumption.

The ```meter_current``` channel is of type ```meter_current``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Alarm (power)
Indicates if a power alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_power``` channel is of type ```alarm_power``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |



## Device Configuration

The device has no configuration parameters defined.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZW681 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: BASIC SET


Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.
