The NZW31S supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

Inovelli's In-Wall Smart Dimmer not only has the ability to control lights from anywhere in the world, but it acts as a Z-Wave signal repeater, which amplifies your Z-Wave signal, growing the capabilities of your network.   
  
In addition, it has scene control enabled, which allows you to double tap the switch to activate a Z-Wave scene. An example would be a bedtime scene, which turns off all lights, locks the door(s) and sets the temperature to 68 degrees.   
  
Simplifying lives, one smart home product at a time... that's Inovelli.

### Inclusion Information

**Including Steps:**

  * This will vary based on the HUB/Gateway you’re using, but you need to go one (1) step before putting your HUB/Gateway in inclusion process — once you are one (1) step away from physically starting the inclusion/pairing process — **THEN STOP!**
  * Walk down to your circuit breaker and flip on the power (you will now have 30 seconds to physically start the inclusion process on your HUB/Gateway)
  * While next to the breaker, start the inclusion process and your HUB/Gateway will automatically start looking for devices
  * Wait for auto-inclusion to do its thing. Your switch will automatically include/pair to your HUB/Gateway 
      * If successful, your device will flash twice (**NOTE:** Auto-Inclusion will time out after 30 seconds)
      * If the switch does not flash within 30 seconds, please use the alternate method of pairing which is pressing the top (UP) button 6x within 2 seconds
  * Confirm that your HUB/Gateway shows the switch

Congratulations, you now have a remote controlled switch!

**If you are having issues pairing your device, please ensure your switch is within range of your HUB. 95% of the pairing/including failures stem from this issue. Best practice is to start with Z-Wave products near your HUB and build your network out. The more Z-Wave devices, the more efficient your network.**

### Exclusion Information

  * Press the Top (UP) Button on your NZW31S six (6) times within 2 seconds

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the NZW31S -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Dimmer | switch_dimmer | switch_dimmer | DimmableLight | Dimmer | 
| Scene Number | scene_number | scene_number |  | Number | 

### Dimmer
The brightness channel allows to control the brightness of a light.
            It is also possible to switch the light on and off.

The ```switch_dimmer``` channel is of type ```switch_dimmer``` and supports the ```Dimmer``` item and is in the ```DimmableLight``` category.

### Scene Number
Triggers when a scene button is pressed.

The ```scene_number``` channel is of type ```scene_number``` and supports the ```Number``` item.
This channel provides the scene, and the event as a decimal value in the form ```<scene>.<event>```. The scene number is set by the device, and the event is as follows -:

| Event ID | Event Description  |
|----------|--------------------|
| 0        | Single key press   |
| 1        | Key released       |
| 2        | Key held down      |
| 3        | Double keypress    |
| 4        | Tripple keypress   |
| 5        | 4 x keypress       |
| 6        | 5 x keypress       |



## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 4 configuration parameters available in the NZW31S.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Dimmer Step Configuration | Dimmer Speed Setting (On/Off) |
| 2 | Dimmer Minimum Configuration | Lowest dim setting before turning off |
| 4 | 	Switch Orientation | Invert On/Off from Top/Bottom |
| 5 | Countdown Timer | Shutoff Timer |
|  | Switch All Mode | Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands |

### Parameter 1: Dimmer Step Configuration

Dimmer Speed Setting (On/Off)
Control the speed with which the dimmer turns on and off.
Values in the range 1 to 99 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Dimmer Minimum Configuration

Lowest dim setting before turning off
Lowest dim setting before turning off
Values in the range 1 to 99 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 4: 	Switch Orientation

Invert On/Off from Top/Bottom
Invert the switch on/off position.

00 - Up = On, Down = Off

01 - Up = Off, Down = On
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Up=ON, Down=OFF |
| 1 | Up=OFF, Down=ON |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Up=ON, Down=OFF).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_4_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 5: Countdown Timer

Shutoff Timer
Countdown timer.

| 1 | Include in All On group |
| 2 | Include in All Off group |
| 255 | Include in All On and All Off groups |

This parameter has the configuration ID ```switchall_mode``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The NZW31S supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
An association command class that allows the device to communicate with other Z-Wave devices directly -- such as sending BASIC REPORT whenever the switch is turned on or off.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.
