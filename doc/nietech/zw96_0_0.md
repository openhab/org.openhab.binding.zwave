Association group_1 is default to associate with the primary controller (Gateway/Hub/Controller) for ZW96 Status change report,

1. ZW96 will trigger AUTO report function if the Switch status had been changed.

2. Device Reset Locally Notification(Only report when the ZW96 Switch Module has been triggered the RESET TO DEFAULT)

Association group_2: basic set command

On (0xFF) or Off (0x00) to its associated group.

Support for Over temperature protection

ZW96 support Over temperature protection,When the temperature is greater than 105 degrees Celsius, the Heat Alarm signal is sent out

Notification Type : Heat Alarm 0x04 . Event :Overheat detected 0x02

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZW96 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Z-Wave Plus Lifeline
