## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The MP21ZP supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Association group 1
Association group_1 is default to associate with the primary controller (Gateway/Hub/Controller) for MP21ZP Status change report,

1. MP21ZP will trigger AUTO report function if the Switch status had been changed.

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Basic set From Endpoint1

Association group 2 : basic set command
When the output of the MP21ZP Enpoint1 socket is changed, On (0xFF) or Off (0x00)or Overload, The MP21ZP will automatically send out a related basic set command. On (0xFF) or Off (0x00) to its associated group.

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Basic set From Endpoint2

Association group 3 : basic set command
When the output of the MP21ZP Enpoint2 socket is changed, On (0xFF) or Off (0x00)orOverload, The MP21ZP will automatically send out a related basic set command. On (0xFF) or Off (0x00) to its associated group.

Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.
