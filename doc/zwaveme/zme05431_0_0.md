The ZME_05431 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

The switch Flush Mountable is a wireless actuator able to switch loads up to 2300 W. The device is delivered as complete set with flush mountable insert, paddle and mounting frame compatible to the design of the switching series Everlux in color white from REV / Duewi. The paddle of the device is used to control the device itself but can also be configured to activate scenes in a central IP gateway or controller. The status of the switch is indicated on a dual color LED for test purposes and every status change is - if configured - reported to a central IP gateway or controller. The function of the local paddle can be configured as detached from the local operation. In this local control, different devices are controlled by Z-Wave while the local actuator is controlled by other devices using Z-Wave. This device is designed for a 3 wire system and needs a neutral wire in the wall box. 

### Inclusion Information

Triple click one of the buttons on the device will include the device

### Exclusion Information
