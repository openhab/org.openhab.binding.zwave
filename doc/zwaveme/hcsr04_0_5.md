The Z-Uno HC-SR04 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

The Z-Uno Module ZMExZUNOM is a Z-Wave module that implements the Z-Wave protocol and allows custom user code execution. It is an ideal solution for home control applications such as appliance control, heating control, access control, AV control, building automation, energy management, lighting, environmental and security sensor networks in the “Internet of Things”. Z-Uno Module have GPIO, ADC, PWM, UART, USB, SPI, I 2C and OneWire available out of the box from the user code. Z-Wave wireless communications and network management is served by the internal firmware of the Z-Uno Module. Works with gateways and directly with other Z-Wave devices. Z-Uno Module is firmware compatible with the Z-Uno prototyping board (ZMExZUNO) to help prototyping on breadboards.

### Inclusion Information

  1. Place the Z-Uno Sensor HC-SR04 within the direct range of your Z-Wave controller.
  2. Set the main controller in (Security/non-Security Mode) add mode (see the controller’s manual).
  3. Quickly three times press the BTN button
  4. Wait for the adding process to end.
  5. Successful adding will be confirmed by the Z-Wave controller’s message.

### Exclusion Information

  1. Place the Z-Uno Sensor HC-SR04 within the direct range of your Z-Wave controller.
  2. Set the main controller into remove mode (see the controller’s manual).
  3. Quickly three times press BTN button.
  4. Wait for the removing process to end.
  5. Successful removing will be confirmed by the Z-Wave controller’s message.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the Z-Uno HC-SR04 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Sensor (distance) | sensor_temperature | sensor_temperature | Temperature | Number:Temperature | 

### Sensor (distance)
Indicates the current temperature.

The ```sensor_temperature``` channel is of type ```sensor_temperature``` and supports the ```Number:Temperature``` item and is in the ```Temperature``` category.



## Device Configuration

The device has no configuration parameters defined.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The device does not support associations.
