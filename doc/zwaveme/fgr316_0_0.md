### Switch
Switch the power on and off.

The ```switch_binary``` channel is of type ```switch_binary``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Switch``` category.

### Binary Sensor
Indicates if a sensor has triggered.

The ```sensor_binary``` channel is of type ```sensor_binary``` and supports the ```Switch``` item. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| ON | Triggered |
| OFF | Untriggered |

### Sensor (temperature)
Indicates the current temperature.

The ```sensor_temperature``` channel is of type ```sensor_temperature``` and supports the ```Number:Temperature``` item and is in the ```Temperature``` category.

### Sensor (general)


The ```sensor_general``` channel is of type ```sensor_general``` and supports the ```Number``` item. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Alarm (access)
Indicates if the access control alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_access``` channel is of type ```alarm_access``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Door``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.
### Switch 1
Switch the power on and off.

The ```switch_binary1``` channel is of type ```switch_binary``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Switch``` category.

### Switch 2
Switch the power on and off.

The ```switch_binary2``` channel is of type ```switch_binary``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Switch``` category.

### Switch 3
Switch the power on and off.

The ```switch_binary3``` channel is of type ```switch_binary``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Switch``` category.

### Switch 4
Switch the power on and off.

The ```switch_binary4``` channel is of type ```switch_binary``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Switch``` category.

### Switch 5
Switch the power on and off.

The ```switch_binary5``` channel is of type ```switch_binary``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Switch``` category.

### Switch 6
Switch the power on and off.

The ```switch_binary6``` channel is of type ```switch_binary``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Switch``` category.

### Sensor (general) 7


The ```sensor_general7``` channel is of type ```sensor_general``` and supports the ```Number``` item. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Sensor (general) 8


The ```sensor_general8``` channel is of type ```sensor_general``` and supports the ```Number``` item. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Sensor (temperature) 9
Indicates the current temperature.

The ```sensor_temperature9``` channel is of type ```sensor_temperature``` and supports the ```Number:Temperature``` item and is in the ```Temperature``` category.

### Binary Sensor 10
Indicates if a sensor has triggered.

The ```sensor_binary10``` channel is of type ```sensor_binary``` and supports the ```Switch``` item. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| ON | Triggered |
| OFF | Untriggered |

### Alarm (access) 10
