The ZME_FT supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

Underfloor heating thermostat allows you to control the heating mat or other load in the on / off mode to maintain the set temperature. The device can operate in two control circuits:

  * autonomous maintenance of the set floor temperature  
    
  * controlled by Z-Wave to maintain the set room temperature (requires an external Z-Wave thermostat,installed indoors)

The kit includes a temperature sensor. In all modes, the thermostat protects the floor structure from overheating, turning off load when the temperature threshold is reached

### Inclusion Information

press and hold the central round mode change button for 5 seconds

### Exclusion Information

## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 7 configuration parameters available in the ZME_FT.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|

| 4 | Temperature control interval |  |
| 5 | Maximum allowed temperature deviation |  |
| 6 | Maximal allowed temperature | Maximal allowed temperature |
| 10 | Typical click timeout | Typical time used to differenciate click from hold |

### Parameter 1: Boost Dry mode duration



Values in the range 0 to 1800 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1800```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Button mode



The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Toggle Normal Heating / Off |
| 1 | Toggle Normal Heating / Energy Save |
| 2 | Toggle Boost Dry |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Toggle Normal Heating / Off).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: Basic mode



The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Toggle Normal Heating / Off |
| 1 | Toggle Normal Heating / Energy Save |
| 2 | Toggle Boost Dry |
| 3 | Set Normal Heating set point temperature |
| 4 | Switch on/off relay directly |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Toggle Normal Heating / Off).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 4: Temperature control interval



Values in the range 1 to 60 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```18```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_5_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 6: Maximal allowed temperature

Maximal allowed temperature
In all modes the thermostat will switch off heating until temperature drops below this limit. For wooden and laminate floor maximal allowed temperature is 27 degree. For tile and concrete floor maximal allowed temperature value is 45 degree.
Values in the range 20 to 55 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```27```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_6_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

Values in the range 1 to 100 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```50```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_10_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZME_FT supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Group 1

Unsolicited notifications about thermostat mode and setpoint temperature changes

Association group 1 supports 10 nodes.
