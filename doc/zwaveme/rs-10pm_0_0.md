The RS-10PM2 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

Haseman RS-10PM2 is a 10-channel, DIN Rail, Relay module with true RMS energy meter.

RS-10PM2 is optically isolated and protected against voltage surges, caused by switching of inductive and capacitive loads as power contactors, motors, EM valves and switching power supplies. Zero-cross switching technology ensures high reliability and long relay life.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The RS-10PM2 supports 10 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.


Association group 1 supports 8 nodes.

### Group 2: S1

BASIC command class for switch S1

Association group 2 supports 8 nodes.

### Group 3: S2

BASIC command class for switch S2

Association group 3 supports 8 nodes.

### Group 4: S3

BASIC command class for switch S3

Association group 4 supports 8 nodes.

### Group 6: S5

BASIC command class for switch S5

Association group 6 supports 8 nodes.

### Group 7: S6

BASIC command class for switch S6

Association group 7 supports 8 nodes.

### Group 8: S7

BASIC command class for switch S7

Association group 8 supports 8 nodes.

### Group 9: S8

BASIC command class for switch S8

Association group 9 supports 8 nodes.

### Group 10: S9

BASIC command class for switch S9

Association group 10 supports 8 nodes.

### Group 11: S10
