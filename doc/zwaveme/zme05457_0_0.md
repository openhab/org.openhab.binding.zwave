The ZME_05457 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

The Z-Wave.Me Switch Flush Mountable is a wireless actuator able to switch loads up to 2300 W. The device is delivered as complete set with flush mountable insert, paddle and mounting frame compatible to the design of the switching series DURO 2000 SI in color pearl white from Busch Jaeger. The paddle of the device is used to control the device itself but can also be configured to activate scenes in a central IP gateway or controller. The status of the switch is indicated on a dual color LED for test purposes and every status change is - if configured - reported to a central IP gateway or controller. The function of the local paddle can be configured as detached from the local operation. In this local control, different devices are controlled by Z-Wave while the local actuator is controlled by other devices using Z-Wave. This device is designed for a 3 wire system and needs a neutral wire in the wall box.

### Inclusion Information

Â Triple click one of the buttons on the device will include the device

### Exclusion Information

The device is excluded by triple click to one of the buttons.

### Wakeup Information

The ZME_05457 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.

The ZME_05457 supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Single Click

Used to control devices using single click

Association group 1 supports 14 nodes.

### Group 2: Double Click

Used to control devices using double click

Association group 2 supports 14 nodes.

### Group 3: Switch Status

Used to report current load status ON/OFF

Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.
