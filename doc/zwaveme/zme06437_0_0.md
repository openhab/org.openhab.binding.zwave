The ZME_06437 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

This is a plug switch that can be placed between a wall outlet for Schuko plugs (plug type F) and electric devices, plugged in by cord. It can switch all loads up to 3500 W. The device is IP 44 rated and can therefore be used both in dry environments as well as humid environments and outdoor. Switching is controlled wirelessly using Z-Wave or locally applying a button. A multi color LED indicates the switching status and the assignment of the colors to the switching status can be defined by the user. The device will report any change of the switching status to a central gateway regardless the origin of the switch (local or wireless). A built in virtual power meter will report the power consumption of the load attached. However the user must configure the assumed constant power draw of the load. The local button can control the local load but can also be used to control other functions in a Z-Wave network. The device is certified and tested against all important European Safety Regulations and fully complies with the Z-Wave Plus standard. The device supports secure communication and the firmware can be upgraded over the air (OTA)

## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 7 configuration parameters available in the ZME_06437.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Set LED indication mode |  |
| 2 | Automatic switch off | If not zero, automatically switch off after a user defined time |
| 3 | Function of RF off command | Function of RF off command |
| 5 | Restore switch state after power cycle | Restore switch state after power cycle |
| 20 | Energy consumption | Energy consumption |
| 21 | Off Color |  |
| 22 | On Color |  |
|  | Switch All Mode | Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands |

### Parameter 1: Set LED indication mode



The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Disabled |
| 1 | Show switch state |
| 2 | Operated by Indicator Command Class |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```2``` (Operated by Indicator Command Class).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Automatic switch off

If not zero, automatically switch off after a user defined time

Values in the range 0 to 65535 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: Function of RF off command

Function of RF off command
Defines how to interpret RF Off-Command. Can be used in conjunction with Auto Off function: Ignore – to switch on the light by motion detectors and switch it off after some amount of time: in case of multiple motion detectors each would try to switch the light off that would break logics; Switch on – to switch on the light on both ON and OFF paddle press on the remote and switch it off after some amount of time. Button OFF click will still work (if button operations are not disabled)
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Switch OFF |
| 1 | Ignore |
| 2 | Switch ON |
| 3 | Switch on if load is off else switch off |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Switch OFF).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 5: Restore switch state after power cycle

Restore switch state after power cycle
Defines if the switch should restore switch state to the last state prior to device power off (power cycle).
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | No, turn off |
| 1 | Yes (Default) |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (Yes (Default)).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_5_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 20: Energy consumption

Energy consumption
Specify the consumption of the load in watts, for the calculation of power consumption. Max load 1800 W.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZME_06437 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Group 1


Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Group 2


Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.
