The FT100 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The FT100 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

Oomi by Fantem’ MultiSensor looks like nothing that has come before. It’s a motion sensor and it’s also so much more. Installing this 1 piece of Z-Wave®technology is the same as installing 6 pieces of Z-Wave technology. Your home control network will immediately understand motion, temperature, humidity,light, Ultraviolet and Vibration readings wherever MultiSensor is installed. Those intelligent readings will equate to intelligent automation. And intelligent automation will give you the perfect smart home.  
MultiSensor can be powered by battery or by USB with an appropriate adaptor.

### Inclusion Information

  1. Set your Z-Wave gateway to accept new products.
  2. Press the Action Button on your MultiSensor.
  3. Test that your sensor has been successfully added your Z-Wave gateway by pressing its Action Button. If you press the button and its LED is solid green for a few seconds, then inclusion has been successful. If the LED blinks green when the button is pressed, the inclusion has been unsuccessful and you should repeat the above steps.

### Exclusion Information

Your MultiSensor can be removed from your Z-Wave network at any time.You’ll need to use your Z-Wave network’s main controller to do this and the following instructions tell you how to do this using Aeotec by Aeon Labs’ Z-Stick and Minimote controllers. If you are using other products as your main Z-Wave controller, please refer to the part of their respective manuals that tells you how remove devices from your network.  
  


If you’re using a Z-Stick:

  1. If your Z-Stick is plugged into a gateway or a computer, unplug it.
  2. Take your Z-Stick to your MultiSensor.
  3. Press and hold the Action Button on your Z-Stick for 3 seconds and then release.
  4. Press the Action Button on your MultiSensor.
  5. If your MultiSensor has been successfully removed from your network, the RGB LED will be active with a colourful gradient for 3 seconds. When you press the Action Button on the MultiSensor, its green LED will blink. If the removal was unsuccessful, the green LED will stay solid for a few seconds when you press the Action Button. Press the Action Button on the Z-Stick to take it out of removal mode.  
  
    

If you’re using a Minimote:

  1. Take your Minimote to your MultiSensor.
  2. Press the Remove Button on your Minimote.
  3. Press the Action Button on your MultiSensor.
  4. If your MultiSensor has been successfully removed from your network, the RGB LED will be active with a colourful gradient for 3 seconds. When you press the Action Button on the MultiSensor, its green LED will blink. If the removal was unsuccessful, the green LED will stay solid for a few seconds when you press the Action Button.
  5. Press any button on your Minimote to take it out of removal mode.

### Wakeup Information

The FT100 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


If your MultiSensor is battery powered, you will need to ensure that it is active when configuring it. To do this, press the Action Button once, which will trigger to send out a wake up notification command.  
If you want it to wake up for 10 minutes, to do this, press and hold its Action Button for 3 seconds and then release it. Your MultiSensor’s orange LED will fast blink for 10 minutes to indicate that it is active.  
When you are done configuring or communicating with your MultiSensor, you can put it back into sleep mode to conserve battery power. To do this, press and hold its Action button for 3 seconds and then release it. Your MultiSensor’s LED should now be off to indicate that it is asleep.

### General Usage Information

Resetting your MultiSensor:

At some stage or your primary controller is missing or inoperable, you may also wish to reset all of your MultiSensor’s settings to their factory defaults. To do this, press and hold the Action Button for 20 seconds and then release it. Your MultiSensor will now be reset to its original settings, and the green LED will be solid for 2 seconds and then be colourful gradient to confirm a success.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_113_4``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The FT100 supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Group 1 is assigned to the Lifeline association group and every device has 5 nodes to associate.The Motion sensor, Humidity sensor, thermometer, light sensor and Ultraviolet sensor reports will be sent to the associated nodes in Group 1.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Group 2


Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Group 3


Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.
