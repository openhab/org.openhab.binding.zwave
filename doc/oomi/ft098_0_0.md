The FT098 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

Oomi Bulb is a Z-Wave LED module which allows control (on/off/dim) with the use of Z-Wave. It's a bulb which has a Smart RGB LED, which can be used to add colour to your home. The bulb has 5 main colour channels available for you to adjust: Red, Green, Blue, Warm White and Cold White. You can configure its colour according to your favour. The Bulb is also a security Z-wave device and supports the Over The Air (OTA) feature for the product's firmware upgrade.  

### Inclusion Information

  1. Toggle off the wall switch before you screw in Bulb and firmly screw in Bulb.
  2. Set your Z-Wave hub into pairing mode.
  3. Toggle off the wall switch controlling your Bulb to turn it off (keep it in the "OFF" state for 2 seconds) and then toggle on the wall switch to turn your Bulb on, the green will blink to indicate the Bulb is entering into pairing mode.
  4. If Bulb has been successfully added to your Z-Wave network, its RGB LED will be solid when you turn Bulb on.

Note:

  1. If your Bulb has already been added into another Z-Wave network, you'll need to remove it from the existing network first. Refer to the Exclusion instructions.
  2. To check if LED Bulb is already paired to an existing network, toggle the wall switch off and on 3 times fast (the final ending position of the wall switch must be on). If LED Bulb blinks orange for 3 seconds, it is already paired into a Z-Wave network.

### Exclusion Information

Your Bulb can be removed from your Z-Wave network at any time. You'll need to use your Z-Wave network's main controller. To set your Z-Wave hub into removal mode, please refer to the respective section within your hubs instruction manual.

  1. Set your Z-Wave hub into device removal mode.
  2. Toggle the wall switch off and on 3 times fast (the final ending position of the wall switch must be on). If successful, the Bulb will change to orange colour for 2 seconds before changing to white. If removal was unsuccessful, then Bulb will blink orange for 3 seconds before changing to red colour for 2 seconds.

## Example

If you set the parameter 39 to 305135616 (0x12300000), the colour will be changed from Red to Orange and then Orange to Yellow circularly (Red-Orange-Yellow)

When the bulb is in Single Colour Mode and the Fade Out Fade In transition style, the parameter 39 would be used to set the RGB value:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      Red value
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      Green value
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      Blue value
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      Reserved
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

When the bulb is in Random Mode, the parameter 39 would be used to set the random seed, then the bulb will automatically generate random colours to be displayed according to the random seed you set.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      Random seed value
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

Values in the range 0 to 0 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_255_4``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The FT098 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Group 1

Lifeline
When the state of Smart Switch (turn on/off the load) is changed:

  1. Set Configuration parameter 80 to 0:Reserved (Default).
  2. Set Configuration parameter 80 to 1:Send Hail CC.
  3. Set Configuration parameter 80 to 2:Send the Basic Report.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Group 2

Retransmit
Forward the Basic Set, Switch Binary Set, Switch Multilevel Start Level Change, Switch Multilevel Stop Level Change, Switch Multilevel Set, Scene Activation Set to associated nodes in Group 2 when the Bulb receives the Basic Set, Switch Binary Set, Switch Multilevel Start Level Change, Switch Multilevel Stop Level Change, Switch Multilevel Set, Scene Activation Set commands from main controller.

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.
