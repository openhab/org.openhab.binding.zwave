The FT096 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

Oomi Plug is a low-cost Z-Wave Switch plug-in module specifically used to enable Z-Wave command and control (on/off) of any plug-in tool.

### Inclusion Information

Press the Action Button on your Plug.

If Plug has been successfully added to your Z-Wave network, its RGB LED will be solid. If the adding was unsuccessful, the red LED will be on for 2 seconds and then remain colourful gradient status, repeat the inclusion

### Exclusion Information

If at some stage, your primary controller is missing or inoperable, you may wish to reset all of your Oomi Plug’s settings to their factory defaults. To do this, press and hold the Action Button for 20 seconds and then release it. Your Oomi Plug will now be reset to its original settings, and the green LED will be solid for 2 seconds and then remain the colourful gradient status as a confirmation.

When the state of Smart Switch (turn on/off the load ) is changed:

  1. Set Configuration parameter 80 to 0 Reserved (Default).
  2. Set Configuration parameter 80 to 1 Send Hail CC.
  3. Set Configuration parameter 80 to 2: Send the Basic Report.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Group 2

forwarding basic set (retransmit)
Forward the Basic Set, Switch Binary Set to associated nodes in Group 2 when the Smart Switch receives the Basic Set, Switch Binary Set commands from main controller.
