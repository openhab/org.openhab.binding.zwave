The STZ1-345 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

The 2GIG-STZ-1 Thermostat is a programmable, Z-Wave communicating thermostat. It can be powered using 24VAC (if both “R”&”C”wires are available at the thermostat) or using four (4) AA batteries. Using Z-Wave technology, you have the ability to use most compatible Z-Wave hubs/controllers to operate the thermostat, configure programming settings as well as displaying current conditions in the home or office.

### Inclusion Information

  1. Set your primary controller to Include, add or Install mode, to add the thermostat as a node on your network (see your controller’s user manual for detailed instructions).
  2. Touch any button to take the thermostat out of sleep mode.
  3. Touch and hold MODE button for 5 seconds. SETUP will be displayed in the status display line.
  4. Scroll to “Z-Wave” using Up/Down buttons. Touch FAN (Select).
  5. When prompted by your Z-Wave controller, select YES in the Z-Wave Install screen.
  6. Touch FAN (Select) to add thermostat to network.
  7. The display line should flash WAIT and then SUCCESS if Z-Wave connection is made.
  8. If Z-Wave does not connect to controller, WAIT, then FAIL will flash in status display line.
  9. If thermostat fails to connect, repeat Steps three (3) through (7) to re-try connecting.

### Exclusion Information

## Device Configuration

The device has no configuration parameters defined.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The STZ1-345 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.


Association group 1 supports 2 nodes.
