The PSC152ZW supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

The wireless flush-mount switching actuator PSC152ZW allows you to remotely control electrical appliances.

It features a metering function to measure the power consumption and the accumulated energy usage of connected equipment. The built-in metering unit is of high quality: it calculates the true-power and also works for small loads from 1W upwards. This feature is important to have a correct measurement value also for electronic loads like led lamps.

The PSC152ZW has a built-in safety features that will switch-off the output in case of too high temperature or overload.   
Additionally the PSC152 has a feature to switch the load on at zero voltage and switch the load off at zero current. This leads to a very high number of possible switching cycles also for difficult loads like led-lamps or motors, e.g. pumps. 

### Inclusion Information

When a PSC152ZW that is not associated to a Z-Wave network is inserted into the mains outlet, it will flash once red followed by 2 green flashes followed by steady red flashing. ThePSC152ZW can now be added to (=inclusion) or removed from (=exclusion) a Z-Wave network:

  1. hold the touch button until the led shows green light
  2. release the touch button

The PSC152 will confirm successful addition to the network by 5 green flashes. 

### Exclusion Information

When a PSC152ZW that is not associated to a Z-Wave network is inserted into the mains outlet, it will flash once red followed by 2 green flashes followed by steady red flashing. ThePSC152ZW can now be added to (=inclusion) or removed from (=exclusion) a Z-Wave network:

  1. hold the touch button until the led shows green light
  2. release the touch button

The PSC152 will confirm successful removal/exclusion by steady red flashing. At the time of exclusion the device is factory reset.

### General Usage Information

Factory Reset:

Please use this procedure only if the primary controller is missing or inoperable: The device can be put into factory default state manually by the following procedure:

  1. hold the touch-button until the led shows red light
  2. release the touch-button and hold the touch-button again until the led starts to flash green

The PSC152ZW confirms the successful completion of the factory reset procedure by steady red flashing.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the PSC152ZW -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Switch | switch_binary | switch_binary | Switch | Switch | 
| Dimmer  [Deprecated]| switch_dimmer | switch_dimmer | DimmableLight | Dimmer | 
| Blinds Control | blinds_control | blinds_control | Blinds | Rollershutter | 
| Electric meter (watts) | meter_watts | meter_watts | Energy | Number | 
| Electric meter (kWh) | meter_kwh | meter_kwh | Energy | Number | 

### Switch
Switch the power on and off.

The ```switch_binary``` channel is of type ```switch_binary``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Switch``` category.

### Dimmer [Deprecated]
The brightness channel allows to control the brightness of a light.
            It is also possible to switch the light on and off.

The ```switch_dimmer``` channel is of type ```switch_dimmer``` and supports the ```Dimmer``` item and is in the ```DimmableLight``` category.

**Note:** This channel is marked as deprecated so should not be used.

### Blinds Control
Provides start / stop control of blinds.

The ```blinds_control``` channel is of type ```blinds_control``` and supports the ```Rollershutter``` item and is in the ```Blinds``` category.

### Electric meter (watts)
Indicates the instantaneous power consumption.

The ```meter_watts``` channel is of type ```meter_watts``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Electric meter (kWh)
Indicates the energy consumption (kWh).

The ```meter_kwh``` channel is of type ```meter_kwh``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.



## Device Configuration

The device has no configuration parameters defined.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The PSC152ZW supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Group 2


Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.
