## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The 914TRLv3 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
<p&gtThe lock supports 2 association groups. Per Z-Wave Plus requirements, group 1 is assigned to the Lifeline group and can only support 1 node.</p&gt <p&gtThe Lifeline group supports the following unsolicited messages:</p&gt <table&gt<tr&gt<td&gt<strong&gtCommand Class</strong&gt</td&gt <td&gt<strong&gtCommand</strong&gt</td&gt </tr&gt<tr&gt<td&gtCommand Class Battery</td&gt <td&gtBattery Report</td&gt </tr&gt<tr&gt<td&gtCommand Class Door Lock </td&gt <td&gtDoor Lock Operation Report</td&gt </tr&gt<tr&gt<td&gtCommand Class Notification</td&gt <td&gtNotification Report</td&gt </tr&gt<tr&gt<td&gtCommand Class Device Reset Locally </td&gt <td&gt <p&gtDevice Reset Locally Notification</p&gt </td&gt </tr&gt</table&gt

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Doorlock notify report

<p&gtWill provide all Notification Reports, via the Command Class Notification, generated by the lock.</p&gt

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.
