## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The Kwikset Obsidian 954 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Z-Wave Plus Lifeline Supports V2
Z-Wave Plus Lifeline Supports the following types of unsolicited messages: Battery Report - sends periodic battery reports containing the battery percentage. Door Lock Operation Report - upon power up, this message will be sent to allow the controller to sync up with the current lock status. Notification Report - many notification types will be sent for status and alarms. The following notification types are supported: Access Control (V2), Home Security (V2), and Power Management (V2). Device Reset Locally Notification - this message will be sent to notify the smart home controller that the lock is resetting back to factory defaults and will be leaving the network.

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Doorlock notify report

provide all Notification Reports
This group will provide all Notification reports as described for the Lifeline. This group allows other controllers, other than the lifeline, to receive these types of unsolicited messages as well.

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.
