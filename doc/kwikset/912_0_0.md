The Kwikset SmartCode 912 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

## Overview

<p&gtThe SmartCode touchpad smart lock lever with Home Connect technology enables the lock to wirelessly communicate with other devices in home. The lock allows the user (through a third-party smart home controller) to remotely check the door lock status, lock or unlock the door and receive notifications. The SmartCode lever is a one-touch locking motorized lever. With your personalized code, you can enter your home with the convenience of keyless entry and the back-lit keypad provides increased visibility. SmartCode is easy to install, program and use, and operates on 4 AA batteries. It also features SmartKey Security as the back-up keyway.</p&gt

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_31_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 33:  first four most significant bytes of the SKU

SKU (length = 8 bytes)
<h1&gtConfiguration Parameter 33 and 34</h1&gt <p&gtThe Configuration Parameter 33 and 34 are used to set the SKU part numbers to the Kwikset locks. Configuration parameter 33 is the first four most significant bytes (MSB). Configuration parameter 34 is the least four significant bytes (LSB). Below describes how Configuration Parameter 33 and 34 are being used.</p&gt <ul&gt<li&gtFor a ZW Configuration Set, the DLM will first do a GET\_SKU\_ID to retrieve the full SKU from the lock, and the lock will respond with all 8 bytes. (If it’s not yet set, the DLM will consider that as all 0x30s.) The DLM changes only the appropriate 4 bytes in its local copy of the SKU, and it then sends the full 8 bytes down to the lock in a SET\_SKU\_ID.</li&gt <li&gtFor a ZW Configuration Get, the DLM will do a GET\_SKU\_ID down to the lock, to which the lock will respond with all 8 bytes. The DLM will return the requested 4 bytes via ZW. If the SKU is not set, it will return all 0x30s (ASCII ‘0’s).</li&gt </ul&gtThis is an advanced parameter and will therefore not show in the user interface without entering advanced mode.
Values in the range 32 to 126 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```32```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_33_4``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 34: four least significant bytes of the SKU.

SKU (length = 8 bytes)
<h1&gtConfiguration Parameter 33 and 34</h1&gt <p&gtThe Configuration Parameter 33 and 34 are used to set the SKU part numbers to the Kwikset locks. Configuration parameter 33 is the first four most significant bytes (MSB). Configuration parameter 34 is the least four significant bytes (LSB). Below describes how Configuration Parameter 33 and 34 are being used.</p&gt <ul&gt<li&gtFor a ZW Configuration Set, the DLM will first do a GET\_SKU\_ID to retrieve the full SKU from the lock, and the loc will respond with all 8 bytes. (If it’s not yet set, the DLM will consider that as all 0x30s.) The DLM changes only the appropriate 4 bytes in its local copy of the SKU, and it then sends the full 8 bytes down to the lock in a SET\_SKU\_ID.</li&gt <li&gtFor a ZW Configuration Get, the DLM will do a GET\_SKU\_ID down to the lock, to which the lock will respond with all 8 bytes. The DLM will return the requested 4 bytes via ZW. If the SKU is not set, it will return all 0x30s (ASCII ‘0’s).</li&gt </ul&gtThis is an advanced parameter and will therefore not show in the user interface without entering advanced mode.
Values in the range 32 to 126 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```32```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_34_4``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 35: Lock Type

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_35_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 40: Factory Reset

Reset Lock to Factory Default
<p&gtThe configuration Parameter 40 is used to set the lock to its factory default settings, except for the anti-theft setting.</p&gt <p&gt• A Read will show a “0”.</p&gt <p&gt• A Write “1” to perform factory reset.</p&gt
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The Kwikset SmartCode 912 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
<p&gtZ-Wave Plus Lifeline Supports the following types of unsolicited messages: Battery Report - sends periodic battery reports containing the battery percentage. Door Lock Operation Report - upon power up, this message will be sent to allow the controller to sync up with the current lock status. Notification Report - many notification types will be sent for status and alarms. The following notification types are supported: Access Control (V2), Home Security (V2), and Power Management (V2). Device Reset Locally Notification - this message will be sent to notify the smart home controller that the lock is resetting back to factory defaults and will be leaving the network.</p&gt

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Group 2

<p&gtThis group will provide all Notification reports as described for the Lifeline. This group allows other controllers, other than the lifeline, to receive these types of unsolicited messages as well.</p&gt <p&gtSupported Command Classes (18): Command Class Anti-theft V2 Command Class Association Group Info Command Class Association V2 Command Class Battery Command Class Configuration Command Class Device Reset Locally Command Class Door Lock Logging Command Class Door Lock V2 Command Class Firmware Update Md V3 Command Class Manufacturer Specific V2 Command Class Notification V4 Command Class Powerlevel Command Class Schedule Entry Lock V2 Command Class Security Command Class Time Parameters Command Class User Code Command Class Version V2 Command Class Z-Wave+ Info V2</p&gt

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.
