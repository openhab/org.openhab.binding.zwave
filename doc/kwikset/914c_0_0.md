## Overview

Kwikset®, the leader in residential security, introduces the Smart Lock Convert Kit with Z-Wave.  
  
Extend your smart home system to your current deadbolt, enabling your existing deadbolt to wirelessly communicate with your smart home or security system

Dramatically reduced, all-metal interior

Works with existing select single cylinder deadbolts

### Inclusion Information

Initiate the process to add the lock to your system at your smart home controller.

**Note**: On some systems you may need to ensure you are using** "secure inclusion"**.

When prompted by your smart home system to add the lock, press button “A” on the lock interior one time. The red LED will illuminate when the lock enters Add Mode. Please allow time for the controller to add the lock to your system.

Note: Some controllers are required to be within close proximity to the lock (less than 12") while including for security reasons. 

### Exclusion Information

Follow your smart home system’s instructions to remove the lock from the network. When prompted by the system, press button A” on the lock interior once.  The red LED will illuminate when the lock enters Remove mode. 

### General Usage Information

Factory Reset:

A factory reset will delete all user codes associated with the lock and will remove itself from your smart home system.  
Please only perform a factory reset when the primary controller is missing or inoperable.  
  
To perform a factory reset, please perform the following:

  1. Remove the battery pack
  2. Press and HOLD the Program button while reinserting the battery pack.
  3. Keep holding the button for 30 seconds until the lock beeps and the status LED flashes red.
  4. Press the Program button once more.  The status LED will flash green and red several times.
  5. After a few seconds, the lock will initiate the door handing process.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the Kwikset 914C Convert Smart Lock -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Door Lock | lock_door | lock_door | Door | Switch | 
| Alarm (raw) | alarm_raw | alarm_raw |  | String | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | system.battery_level | Battery | Number |

### Door Lock
Lock and unlock the door.

The ```lock_door``` channel is of type ```lock_door``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Door``` category.
The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

|-------|-----------|
| ON | Locked |
| OFF | Unlocked |

### Alarm (raw)
Provides alarm parameters as json string.

The ```alarm_raw``` channel is of type ```alarm_raw``` and supports the ```String``` item. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.
This channel sets, and provides the alarm state as a JSON string. It is designed for use in rules.
### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.

Values in the range 0 to 15 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```5```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_31_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.
This is a read only parameter.


### Parameter 33: First 4 bytes of SKU

SKU (length = 8 bytes)
The configuration parameters 33 and 34 are used to set and get the SKU part numbers. The SKU is made up of 8 bytes. Each parameter consists of four bytes of data. Parameter 33 contains the first four most significant bytes of the SKU, while parameter 34 contains the four least significant bytes of the SKU.

When setting the SKU, it must be done in two set commands, one for each parameter. The order of programming the SKU does not matter.

Setting parameter 33 will program the first four bytes of the SKU. Setting parameter 34 will program the last 4 bytes of the SKU. Most printable values are accepted for the set command.

When getting the SKU, it must be done in two get commands, one for each parameter. The order of getting the SKU does not matter.

Getting parameter 33 will retrieve the first four bytes of the SKU. Getting parameter 34 will retrieve the last 4 bytes of the SKU. This is an advanced parameter and will therefore not show in the user interface without entering advanced mode.
Values in the range 32 to 126 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```32```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_33_4``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

Parameter 33 contains the first four most significant bytes of the SKU, while parameter 34 contains the four least significant bytes of the SKU.

When setting the SKU, it must be done in two set commands, one for each parameter. The order of programming the SKU does not matter.

Setting parameter 33 will program the first four bytes of the SKU. Setting parameter 34 will program the last 4 bytes of the SKU. Most printable values are accepted for the set command.

When getting the SKU, it must be done in two get commands, one for each parameter. The order of getting the SKU does not matter.

Getting parameter 33 will retrieve the first four bytes of the SKU. Getting parameter 34 will retrieve the last 4 bytes of the SKU. This is an advanced parameter and will therefore not show in the user interface without entering advanced mode.
Values in the range 32 to 126 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_40_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Lock Timeout

Sets the time after which the door will auto lock.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```doorlock_timeout``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The Kwikset 914C Convert Smart Lock supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Group 1

Lifeline
Z-Wave Plus Lifeline Supports the following types of unsolicited messages:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <strong>Command Class</strong>
    </td>
    
    <td>
      <strong>Command</strong>
    </td>
    
    <td>
      <strong>Info</strong>
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      Command Class Battery
    </td>
    
    <td>
      Battery Report
    </td>
    
    <td>
      Sends periodic battery reports containing the battery percentage.
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      Command Class Door Lock
    </td>
    
    <td>
      Door Lock Operation Report
    </td>
    
    <td>
      Upon power up, this message will be sent to allow the controller to sync up with the current lock status.
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      Command Class Notification
    </td>
    
    <td>
      Notification Report
    </td>
    
    <td>
      Many notification types will be sent for status and alarms. The following notification types are supported: Access Control (V2) and Power Management (V2).
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      Command Class Device Reset Locally
    </td>
    
    <td>
      Device Reset Locally Notification
    </td>
    
    <td>
      This message will be sent to notify the smart home controller that the lock is resetting back to factory defaults and will be leaving the network.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Group 2

Doorlock notify group
This group will provide all Notification reports as described for the Lifeline. This group allows other controllers, other than the lifeline, to receive these types of unsolicited messages as well.

It allows at most 5 other nodes to be associated with the lock and will provide all Notification Reports, via the Command Class Notification, generated by the lock. 

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.
