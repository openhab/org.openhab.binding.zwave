The Kwikset 620 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

The lock will support the Lifeline association group. It supports sending messages to a maximum of 5 nodes. These messages provide information on changes that occur locally.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.
