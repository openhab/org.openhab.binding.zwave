The ZXT-600 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

ZXT-600 AC Master is a Z-Wave plus certified IR Bridge for split air conditioner control by receiving Z-Wave command and translating to Infrared command and flawlessly work with any Z-Wave compliant gateway.

With its over 250 brands built-in code library and ever-green up to date cloud IR database supporting advanced code learning search, ZXT-600 can easily set up and smart control most of AC brands and models actively worldwide by Z-Wave gateway.

The battery powered device will allow you to mount it anywhere you want such as wall, ceiling or put it on table and never compromise on the form factor. By supporting OTA function, gateway can enable ZXT-600 to update firmware if newest available. 

### Inclusion Information

Please consult your Gateway supplier for more detail. Normally, User can ignore this step during the setup. ZXT-600 supports 1 association group Association Group #1 Association Group #1 (max. 1 node) is default to associate with the primary controller (Gateway/Hub/Controller) for AC Master Status change report, refer to below for report details:

  * Current Room Temperature (report in precision of 0.5°C or 1°F) (It will be according to Configuration Parameter 39 setting to decide the trigger level)
  * Current Battery Level (Only apply in Low Battery Warning happened)
  * Device Reset Locally Notification (Only report when the AC Master has been triggered the RESET TO DEFAULT)

**Step 1** Apply Power to ZXT-600

  * 2x AA batteries or micro USB
  * ZXT-600 will detect the first applied power source to decide what Z-Wave device role it will be in after included into the Z-Wave gateway: battery= sleeping device (FLiRS mode). USB power = always awake device (Always Listening mode), refer to Z-Wave Glossary for more information.
  * Once the ZXT-600 is included into a Z-Wave network, the working mode (sleeping or awake) cannot be changed, unless it is excluded and re-apply the power.
  * ZXT-600 can be included and operated in any Z-Wave network with other Z-Wave certified devices from other manufacturers and/or other applications. All non-battery operated nodes within the network will act as repeaters regardless of Vendor to increase reliability of the network.

**Step 2** Include ZXT-600 to a Z-Wave Gateway

Step Procedure / Description Status Indicator 1 Refer to your primary controller to enter into the Inclusion Mode or Exclusion Mode 2 When it is prompted to enter it, please triple click the “PROG” button within 1 second. Green Indicator flashes TWICE then stay off.

### Exclusion Information

Red Indicator flashes TWICE then stay off to represent the Add / Remove process failed, please repeat the above step again. If the Add (Include) process fails, try Remove (Exclude) and /or resetting the AC Master to Factory Default and repeat the above step

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZXT-600 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Z-Wave Plus Lifeline

Association group 1 supports 1 node.
