The ZXT-800 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

The ZXT-800 is a Z-Wave™plus compliant Z-Wave™-to-IR Bridge to control split air conditioner and entertainment devices by receiving Z-Wave™ commands and translating them into Infrared commands. With a built-in and cloud-stored IR database (library) the ZXT-800 can control different brands and models of infrared devices world-wide.The ZXT-800 can be set from the gateway to a particular brand with the correct IR code. Users can set up the IR (AV + AC) code using the “Conexum ZXT-800” App through Bluetooth download. iOS and Android Apps are available in the app-store.

### Inclusion Information

Once the primary controller is ready to include the device, press the “PROG” button once.

### Exclusion Information

Once the primary controller is ready to exclude the device, press the “PROG” button once.

### General Usage Information

**Reset:**  
Use this procedure only when the network primary controller is missing or otherwise inoperable. Press and keep holding the “PROG” button not less than 10 seconds: LED will light up at first 5 seconds, and flashes twice then stay off after reset process completed.

**IR Code Setup:**  
The XZT-800 AC/AV Master can be set up for different IR Code sets depending on brand and type. This can be done through Z-Wave configuration options in openHAB or by using the “Conexum ZXT-800” smartphone app. Refer to the manual for instructions.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZXT-800 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Lifeline to controller

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.
