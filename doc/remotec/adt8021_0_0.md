### Parameter 17: Dimming time frame

Dimming time frame
Sets the time of moving the Dimmer from 0% to max. dimming values.

(The ZDM-80 will implement the dimming duration if received this parameter value from controller/gateway. Otherwise, the ZDM-80 will implement the local parameter value)
Values in the range 0 to 5 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```3```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_17_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 18: Maximum Dimmer level control

Maximum Dimmer level control
Define the upper dimming level. Higher percentages lead to higher brightness level.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZDM-80 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Group 1

Association group_1 is used to report status change such as AUTO report to gateway.

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Group 2

# Dimmer mode: 

ZDM-80 will send out related dimming level e.g. 50% by basic set command to its association group automatically when ZDM-80 received the dimming command by local switch or wireless command e.g. 50%. 

# Switch mode: 

ZDM-80 will send out related basic set command On (0xFF) or Off (0x00) to its association group automatically when ZDM-80 received On (0xFF) or Off (0x00) command by local switch or wireless command respectively. (Max. 4 nodes ID can be assigned to this association group)

Association group 2 supports 4 nodes.
