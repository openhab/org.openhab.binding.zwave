The ZDS-210NA supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

Thank you for choosing the ZDS-210 (Dimming Switch Module) Z-Wave control product. ZDS-210 enabled product allows users to remotely control lighting, home appliance, and make home control easy with low installation and maintenance costs.

### Inclusion Information

# Note:

ZDS-210 can be configured as either a "DIMMER" or a "SWITCH" device, and it will detect the operation mode using the position of the slide switch when powering on. The ZDS-210 will stay in the selected operation mode after inclusion process, and it will not respond to the slide switch selection after removing and re-adding power.

If the user needs to change the operation mode, the user must first perform an exclusion process. The user will then switch to the target operation mode (Dimmer or Switch), and re-include the ZDS-210 afterwards.

When prompted by your primary controller, triple click the PROG button within 1 second.

### Exclusion Information

When prompted by your primary controller, triple click the PROG buttonÂ within 1 second.

### Parameter 5: State after power failure

State after power failure

The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Switch OFF |
| 1 | Switch saves its state before power failure |

(The ZDS-210 will implement the dimming duration if received this parameter value from controller/gateway.Otherwise, the ZDS-210 will implement the local parameter value)
Values in the range 0 to 5 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```3```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_17_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 18: Maximum Dimmer level control

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZDS-210NA supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Group 2

# Dimmer mode:

After receiving a dimming command from a local switch or gateway (e.g. 50%), the ZDS-210 will automatically send out a related basic set command (e.g. 50%) to its associated group.

# Switch mode:

After receiving a basic set command from a local switch or gateway, On (0xFF) or Off (0x00), the ZDS-210 will automatically send out a related basic set command, On (0xFF) or Off (0x00) to its associated group.

Association group 2 supports 4 nodes.
