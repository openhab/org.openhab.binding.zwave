The Plug-In Smart Meter Dimmer Switch supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

This ZWN-323 Dimming Module is a Z-Wave enabled device and is fully interoperable with other Z-Wave certified device. In a Z-Wave network, ZWN-323M enable you to remotely ON/OFF&Dim control a Z-Wave ZWN-323M also acts as a repeater, retransmitting the RF signal from one device to another until the intended device is reached. With a horizontal design, the ZWN-323M plug-in dimmer module will not block other nearby AC outlets.

### Inclusion Information

 While the gateway/remote is in the adding mode and the blue LED blinks on the ZWN-323M, press the program button on the module. 

### Exclusion Information

While the gateway or remote in the deleting mode, press the program button on the ZWN-323M. The gateway or remote will verify the deleting, remove the module from the current Z-Wave network, and the LED will blink on the module.
