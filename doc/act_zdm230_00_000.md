#### 1: Ignore Start-Level (Transmitting)

Dimmers controlled by this switch will start dimming from their current level.  


##### Overview 

Set ignore start level bit when transmitting dim commands. The ZDM230 can send Dim commands to Z-Wave enabled dimmers. The Dim command has a start level embedded in it. A dimmer receiving this command will start dimming from that start level. However, the command also has a bit that indicates whether the dimmer should ignore the start level. If the bit is set to 1, the dimmer will ignore the start level and instead start dimming from its current level. If this bit is set to 0, the dimmer will not ignore the start level.


| Property         | Value    |
|------------------|----------|
| Configuration ID | config_1_1 |
| Data Type        | INTEGER || Default Value | 1 |
| Options | No (0) |
|  | Yes (1) |


#### 2: Suspend group 4

Disable transmitting commands to Z-Wave devices that are in Group 4 without disassociating those devices from the group.  


##### Overview 

You may wish to disable transmitting commands to Z-Wave devices that are in Group 4 without “disassociating” those devices from the group. Setting parameter 2 to the value of 1 will stop the ZDM230 from transmitting to devices that are “associated” into Group 4. It is possible that you may only want the units in Group 4 to track when the dimmer is being turned ON and OFF and not when dimming.


| Property         | Value    |
|------------------|----------|
| Configuration ID | config_2_1 |
| Data Type        | INTEGER || Default Value | 0 |

|  | Yes (1) |


#### 3: Night Light

n night-light mode the LED on the switch will turn ON when the switch is turned OFF.  


##### Overview 

The LED on the ZDM230 will by default, turn ON when the load attached is turned ON. To make the LED turn ON when the load attached is turned OFF instead, set parameter 3 to a value of 1.


| Property         | Value    |
