The TF016 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

The Heatit Z-Wave is designed for controlling electrical heating cables and electrical radiators/convectors. The thermostat has 2 internal temperature sensors and has 3 algorithms for temperature compensation. After you have set the temperature, the thermostat will use a hysteresis to regulate the temperature. The hysteresis is adjustable.

The temperature shown in the display is the actual temperature for floor sensor and the external room sensor. You are able to calibrate the sensor values. When using the internal room sensor, the temperature shown is the set point. When using the internal sensor, the thermostat can seem somewhat inaccurate. This is due to heat generation inside the thermostat, draft and other external influences.

1.92 is an unofficial firmware upgrade with the following changes:

* Reporting of the relay status is fixed.

* All temperature sensors can be reported (internal, floor, external) via its association groups

### Inclusion Information

To include the thermostat to your home automation gateway, press Center (confirm) for 10 seconds. The display will show OFF. Press Right (down) 4 times till you see Con in the display. Now start add device in your home automation software. Start inclusion mode by pressing Center (confirm) for approximately 2 seconds. The inclusion/exclusion icon will appear in the display. Confirmation will show Inc/EcL in the display. If inclusion fails, Err (error) will appear. Leave programming mode by choosing ESC in menu. Your thermostat is ready for use with default settings

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The TF016 supports 5 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 8 nodes.

### Group 2: On/Off control

When heating is activated, ON is sent to this channel, and when turned off (due to reaching setpoint), OFF will be sent.

Association group 2 supports 8 nodes.

### Group 3: Internal temperature sensor


Association group 3 supports 8 nodes.

### Group 4: External temperature sensor


Association group 4 supports 8 nodes.

### Group 5: Floor temperature sensor


Association group 5 supports 8 nodes.
