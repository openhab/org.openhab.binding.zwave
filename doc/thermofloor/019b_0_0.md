The HeatIt ZDim supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

Z-Wave rotary dimmer for different light sources. The LED dimmer dims at low load without the light flickering. Dimmer LED from 1-200VA, 230V halogen and incandescent bulbs, dimmable LED drivers and electronic transformers. Not affected by additional starting currents. Need L + N conductor connected.

The dimmer has end-turn function. This allows you to turn on the light and dimming with one dimmer, and then turn off the light with another dimmer. Convenient for example in stairs and corridors.

The dimmer fits into standard Elko, Schneider Exxact and Gira System 55 frame systems.

### Inclusion Information

When the primary controller is set to add/remove modus press the main button on the dimmer 6 times in a rapid sequence.

### Exclusion Information

When the primary controller is set to add/remove modus press the main button on the dimmer 6 times in a rapid sequence.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The HeatIt ZDim supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Lifeline. (Normally used by the Z-Wave Controller)

Sends:

  * Multilevel Switch Report
  * Meter Report
  * Device Reset Locally
  * Central Scene Notification

Association group 1 supports 8 nodes.

### Group 2: Dimming level

Basic Set: is usually used to controll other dimmer devices.

Association group 2 supports 8 nodes.

### Group 3: State of Device ON/OFF

Binary Switch Set: is usually used to control other ON/OFF devices. 

Association group 3 supports 8 nodes.
