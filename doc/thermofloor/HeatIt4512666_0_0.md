## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The HEATIT Z-TEMP2 supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Lifeline. (Normally used by the Z-Wave Controller)
Lifeline. (Normally used by the Z-Wave Controller) Sends:

- Battery Report (sent when battery runs low).

- Notification Report (sent first time power on).

- Device Reset Locally Notification (sent if device is reset).

- Indicator Report

- Thermostat Mode Report (sent when mode changed from panel).

- Thermostat Setpoint Report (sent when setpoint changed from panel).

- Thermostat Operating State Report (sent when heating should be active).

- Sensor Multilevel Report (periodical reports).

- Protection Report (childlock activated/deactived from panel).

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Temperature Report

Multilevel Sensor Report (internal measured temperate and measured relative humidity).

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: ON/OFF Control

Binary Switch Set (normally used to control external relays).
Binary Switch Set (normally used to control external relays).

Sends:

0x00 = OFF

0xFF = ON

Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.
