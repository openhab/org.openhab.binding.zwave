The HEATIT Z-RELAY supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

The Heatit Z-Relay is a Z-Wave module in a water-resistant housing equipped with 10 x membrane cable entries. 

The Heatit Z-Relay is equipped with 1 relay output and 3 multi-purpose inputs, and a Z-Wave radio for interfacing to the wireless Z-Wave network. The module must be power supplied from a 230V AC mains connection. 

This heavy-duty relay can be freely controlled from the Z-Wave network, and can be used for several purposes, e.g. control of valve actuators, stoves etc. 

Two of the Heatit Z-Relay inputs can be configured to function as either digital inputs or as analogue inputs for interfacing simple NTC temperature sensors. When the inputs are used as digital inputs, they can be connected to potential free contacts, open-collector outputs, and will be able to control other Z-Wave devices when the status of the inputs sent to other Z-Wave devices on the Z-Wave network. The last input can be used as either digital input or be used to be connected to a flood detector. 

It is possible to configure the level- and the indication of the status indicator LED on the modules circuit board.

### Inclusion Information

On delivery, the device does not belong to any Z-Wave network. The device needs to be added to an existing wireless network to communicate with the devices of this network. Devices can also be removed from a network. Both add and remove process are initiated by the primary controller of the Z-Wave network. This controller will be turned into a mode for adding or removing devices. Please refer to your primary controller’s manual on how to turn your controller into add or remove mode. Only if the primary controller is in add or remove mode, this device can be added or removed from the network. When the device is removed from the network, it will set the device back to factory default. 

If the device already belongs to a network, follow the remove process before adding it in your network. Otherwise, the adding of this device will fail. Place your primary controller in Adding Mode by following the manufacturer’s instructions, then activate the add mode on the device by clicking the inclusion button in the module. The Adding Mode is indicated by status LED is blinking until a timeout occurs after 10 seconds or if the module has been added to the Z-Wave network.  

### Exclusion Information

The device is removed in the same manner, when the controller is put into Removing Mode. 

### General Usage Information

1. Inputs

1.1.   Temperature inputs

Input 1 and 2 can be used as temperature inputs by connecting NTC sensors the inputs, the type of NTC sensor can be configured by means of configuration parameter 3 and 4. 

A temperature offset can be configured for each of the inputs by means of configuration parameter 5 and 6. 

1.2.   Flood sensor input

Input 3 is a flood sensor input where it is possible to connect a simple flood sensor.

The flood sensor can be left lying on the floor (on an electrically insulating surface), or attached to the floor or to a wall. Designed for flood detection, senses water and other electrically conductive liquids. The sensitivity of the sensor can be configured by means of configuration parameter 14. 

It is possible for the flood input directly to be able to control the SRM relay output, either to turn the relay output ON or OFF when flood is detected, or when no flood is detected, see configuration parameter 12 and 13.

2. Relay Output

The relay output is a high power “normally open” (NO) contact, that can be used for several purposes. 

It is possible to control the relay from the Z-Wave network, or it can be controlled by the flood sensor input. 

The Heatit Z-Relay monitors the current used by the load connected to the relay output. The energy that the load consumes is calculated by means of the measured current and the voltage entered in configuration parameter 15. Energy data is sent to the controller through the Z-Wave network. These data values that the controller is able to receive are; current (A), power (Watt) and the energy consumed over time (kWh).

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The HEATIT Z-RELAY supports 6 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Lifeline group for the entire module. Sends Basic Report On / Off when the relay is turned on or off. Sends Meter Report with energy data for the load connected to the relay output.

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Sensor Multilevel Report Input 1

Sends Sensor Multilevel Report for input 1. Nodes in this group will receive information of the current temperature measured by the NTC connected to input 1.

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Sensor Multilevel Report for Input 2

Sends Sensor Multilevel Report for input 2. Nodes in this group will receive information of the current temperature measured by the NTC connected to input 2.

Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 4: Basic Report On / Off

Nodes in this group receives Basic Report On / Off when the flood sensor detects a flood. Normally used for visualization in the Controller.

Association group 4 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 5: Basic Set On / Off

Nodes in this group receives Basic Set On / Off when the flood sensor detects a flood.

Association group 5 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 6: Notification Report

Nodes in this group receives Notification Report when the flood sensor detects a flood. The notification events reported are: ”Water leak detected ”0x02 and ”ldle” 0x00.

Association group 6 supports 5 nodes.
