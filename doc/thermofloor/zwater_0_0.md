### Inclusion Information

Place your primary controller in Adding Mode by following the manufacturer’s instructions, then activate the add mode on the device by clicking the small button through the little hole, marked with the text “INCLUSION”, in front of the Heatit Z-Water regulator. The Adding Mode is indicated by Heatit Z-Water status LED is blinking until a timeout occurs after 10 seconds or if the module has been added to the Z-Wave network.

### Exclusion Information

Place your primary controller in Remov Mode by following the manufacturer’s instructions, then activate the remove mode on the device by clicking the small button through the little hole, marked with the text “INCLUSION”, in front of the Heatit Z-Water regulator.

### General Usage Information

Heatit Z-Water is a DIN-rail regulator for controlling hydronic heating. Heatit Z-Water is a module that clips right onto a DIN rail to add a variety of functions to your wireless Z-Wave network.  
Heatit Z-Water is equipped with 10 relay outputs and it has 4 analog/digital inputs. The module can be power supplied from a 230V AC mains connection, and is able to deliver an output supply of 24V DC or 230V. Heatit Z-Water relay outputs are able to be freely controlled from the Z-Wave network, and can be used for several purposes, e.g. on/off control of light, control of valve actuators for an underfloor heating system, or control of other home automation systems.

Heatit Z-Water analog/digital inputs (different firmware versions) can be configured to work with different functionality and can be connected to potential free contacts, open-collector outputs, and will be able to control other Z-Wave devices; switches, dimmers, etc. Furthermore, the inputs can be used as a Scene Controller and send Central Scene notifications to the Z-Wave gateway.  
It is possible to configure the level and the indication of the status indicator LED in the front of the Heatit Z-Water module.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The Heatit Z Water supports 13 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Sends Device Reset notifications, Central Scene notifications and Basic Report On / Off to the controller

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Input 1 Basic Set On / Off 

Sends Basic Set On / Off when input 1 is activated.

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

Association group 4 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 5: Input 2 Basic Set On / Off

Sends Basic Set On / Off when input 2 is activated. Can be used for controlling other Z-Wave devices, e.g. relay modules.

Association group 5 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 6: Input 2 Switch Binary Set On / Off
