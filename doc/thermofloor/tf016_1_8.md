The TF016 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

The Heatit Z-Wave is designed for controlling electrical heating cables and electrical radiators/convectors. The thermostat has 2 internal temperature sensors and has 3 algorithms for temperature compensation. After you have set the temperature, the thermostat will use a hysteresis to regulate the temperature. The hysteresis is adjustable.

The temperature shown in the display is the actual temperature for floor sensor and the external room sensor. You are able to calibrate the sensor values. When using the internal room sensor, the temperature shown is the set point. When using the internal sensor, the thermostat can seem somewhat inaccurate. This is due to heat generation inside the thermostat, draft and other external influences.

If the thermostat is to be used with waterbased heating systems, you have to use an external sensor.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The TF016 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 8 nodes.

### Group 2: On/Off control


Association group 2 supports 8 nodes.
