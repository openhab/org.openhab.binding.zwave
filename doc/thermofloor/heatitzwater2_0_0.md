## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The Heatit Z-Water2 supports 13 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Sends Device Reset notifications, Central Scene notifications and Basic Report On / Off to the controller

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Input 1 Basic Set On / Off 

Sends Basic Set On / Off when input 1 is activated.

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Input 1 Switch Binary Set On / Off

Sends Switch Binary Set On / Off when input 1 is activated.

Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 4: Input 1 Multilevel Switch Set 

Sends Multilevel Switch Set / Multilevel Switch Start Level Change / Multilevel Switch Stop Level Change when input 1 is activated. Is typically used for controlling light dimmers, curtain controllers, etc

Association group 4 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 5: Input 2 Basic Set On / Off

Sends Basic Set On / Off when input 2 is activated. Can be used for controlling other Z-Wave devices, e.g. relay modules.

Association group 5 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 6: Input 2 Switch Binary Set On / Off 

Sends Switch Binary Set On / Off when input 2 is activated. Can be used for controlling other Z-Wave devices, e.g. relay modules.

Association group 6 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 7: Input 2 Multilevel Switch Set 

Sends Multilevel Switch Set / Multilevel Switch Start Level Change / Multilevel Switch Stop Level Change when input 2 is activated. Is typically used for controlling light dimmers, curtain controllers, etc.
