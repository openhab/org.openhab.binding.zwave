## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The Z-TRM2fx supports 4 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
The main thermostat device
Lifeline. (Normally used by the Z-Wave Controller) Sends:

  * Device Reset Notifications.
  * Thermostat Setpoint Reports
  * Thermostat Mode Reports
  * Basic Reports
  * Meter Reports

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: External temperature

Send Multilevel Sensor Reports for external temperature sensor.

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Floor temperature

Send Multilevel Sensor Reports for floor temperature sensor.

Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 4: Internal relay status

Send Binary Switch Set commands representing the status of the internal relay.

Association group 4 supports 5 nodes.
