If value = 1, the LED indicator will be OFF when the connected appliance is OFF, and the LED indicator will be ON when the connected appliance is ON. If value = 2, the LED indicator will be always OFF regardless of the load status.
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | LED opposite to Load |
| 1 | LED same as Load |
| 2 | LED always OFF |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (LED opposite to Load).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZL-PA-100 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Device status
  1. PA-100 supports group one for lifeline communication.
  2. You can only associate one Z-Wave device to group one.
  3. Lifeline association only supports the "manual reset" event.

Association group 1 supports 1 node.
