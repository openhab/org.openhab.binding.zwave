The ZL-LD-100 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

ZLINK LD-100 is a Z-Wave PlusÂ® certified device with S2 Security and SmartStart.

LD-100 is a member of the Z-Wave family and communicates with other Z-Wave certified devices in a control network. LD-100 is designed to detect and alert any water leaks in residential or commercial buildings.

LD-100 features an audible alarm in addition to a wireless alert to your controller providing early notification of water leaks before major damage occurs. For more information on this and other quality ZLINK Products please visit www.ZLINKProducts.com.

### Inclusion Information

Add or remove the device into your network by a Z-Wave certified controller. If the controller is SmartStart comparable, refer to the controller manufacturer app that allows the DSK code to be scanned, and scan the DSK code on the side of the unit or on the box. If your controller is not S2/ SmartStart comparable, the device can be added or removed using the traditional method for Z-Wave as follows:  


  1. Place your controller into Inclusion/Exclusion (Add/Remove) mode by following the controller manufacturer's instructions. 
  2. When the controller is ready, single-click the button of LD-100. The controller should indicate that the new device was added/ removed successfully. If the controller shows it failed, repeat the procedure.

Note: When on battery power, the unit will stay awake for 5 minutes after the button is pressed. Once the unit detects inclusion has completed, it will be able to start detecting every minute and will allow controllers to set any necessary configuration parameters.

### Exclusion Information

Add or remove the device into your network by a Z-Wave certified controller. If the controller is SmartStart comparable, refer to the controller manufacturer app that allows the DSK code to be scanned, and scan the DSK code on the side of the unit or on the box. If your controller is not S2/ SmartStart comparable, the device can be added or removed using the traditional method for Z-Wave as follows:

| Binary Sensor | sensor_binary | sensor_binary |  | Switch | 
| Sensor (temperature) | sensor_temperature | sensor_temperature | Temperature | Number:Temperature | 
| Alarm (flood) | alarm_flood | alarm_flood | Water | Switch | 

### Switch
Switch the power on and off.

The ```switch_binary``` channel is of type ```switch_binary``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Switch``` category.

### Binary Sensor
Indicates if a sensor has triggered.

The ```sensor_binary``` channel is of type ```sensor_binary``` and supports the ```Switch``` item. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| ON | Triggered |
| OFF | Untriggered |

### Sensor (temperature)
Indicates the current temperature.

The ```sensor_temperature``` channel is of type ```sensor_temperature``` and supports the ```Number:Temperature``` item and is in the ```Temperature``` category.

### Alarm (flood)
Indicates if the flood alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_flood``` channel is of type ```alarm_flood``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Water``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |



## Device Configuration

Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 2 | Leak notification | Beep and notification frequency once water is detected |
| 3 | Temperature reporting | Temperature reporting interval on micro USB power |
| 4 | Notification buzzer | Audible buzzer on/off |

### Parameter 2: Leak notification

Beep and notification frequency once water is detected

Values in the range 0 to 2 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: Temperature reporting

Temperature reporting interval on micro USB power

Values in the range 30 to 255 may be set.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZL-LD-100 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Group 1

Lifeline communication
Supports:

1. Battery report  
2. Notification report  


3. Sensor multilevel report  
4. Device reset locally notification

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Group 2

Basic Set
LD-100 will send a Basic Set to the associated devices, for example, turning on lights or engaging the water auto shut-off valve, when water is detected.

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.
