### Inclusion Information

<p&gtTo start the motion detector's inclusion, turn the device's control dial to "Set" and back to "0" within 5 seconds.</p&gt

### Exclusion Information

<p&gtTo start the motion detector's exclusion mode, turn the device's control dial to "Set" and back to "0" within 5 seconds.</p&gt <p&gtFollowing exclusion, all configuration parameters (time, sensitivity etc.) remain intact until next inclusion and the light now works in standalone mode – as a result, Z-Wave can also be used for the light’s standalone setting. Z-Wave control dial (E) Control dial for inclusion and exclusion as well as for returning the device to the factory setting.</p&gt

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The IS140-2 supports 4 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Lifeline
<p&gt- Device Reset Locally (immediately)<br /&gt- Notifications:<br /&gt0x09 (System) – Hardware failure with manufacturer proprietary code (0x03)<br /&gt0x09 (System) – Software failure with manufacturer proprietary code (0x04)<br /&gt0x07 (Home security) – Motion Begin event (0x08)<br /&gt0x07 (Home security) – Motion End event (0x00, 0x08)<br /&gt- Binary Switch Report (SPIR)<br /&gt- Binary Switch Report (SBIN)<br /&gt- Multilevel Switch Report (SMUL)<br /&gt- Multilevel Sensor Report – value of internal ambient light sensor<br /&gt- Central scene notification (STOGGLE)<br /&gtMotion Begin and Motion End events are sent along with frames to group 3.<br /&gtIf multichannel association is created the events are sent from motion sensor<br /&gtendpoint.<br /&gtSwitch Report is sent immediately upon a change of status along with<br /&gtframes to group 2. If multichannel association is created the events are sent<br /&gtfrom lamp/relay endpoint.<br /&gtMultilevel Sensor Report is sent a maximum of once per 1 minute<br /&gt(if the value has changed by at least 3%) and a minimum of once per 15 min-<br /&gtutes (if the value has not changed). If the ambient light value is old (cannot<br /&gtbe measured because of permanent light), the value is not transmitted via<br /&gtlifeline. Multilevel Sensor Report can also be added to some other events to<br /&gtsend in bulk. If multichannel association is created the events are sent from<br /&gtlight sensor endpoint.<br /&gtCentral scene notification is sent as reaction to user interaction. If multichan-<br /&gtnel association is created the events are sent from toggle button endpoint.</p&gt <p&gtAll notifications to lifeline are sent as sensor states regardless of sensor<br /&gtsettings and states as SLAVE\_MODE, LOCAL\_DISABLED and MOTION_<br /&gtENABLE</p&gt

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Control: Key01

On/Off control
<p&gtGroup 2 is used for directly controlling Z-Wave devices via BASIC SET com-<br /&gtmands through the evaluation of movement and light, as with internal use<br /&gt(so that all of these devices work together). This is intended for use especially<br /&gtwith third-party devices that do not implement reactions for motion events.<br /&gtBASIC\_SET and similar Z-Wave commands are not retransmitted intention-<br /&gtally to slaves and must be sent to slave devices via the controlling device<br /&gtsimultaneously. Only for use in master-slave system, multi-device control is<br /&gtnot possible.<br /&gtGroup 2 is evaluated and frames are transmitted there also in SLAVE\_<br /&gtMODE, regardless of LOCAL\_DISABLED state and when MOTION\_ENABLE<br /&gtis off (not using internal motion sensor, just reacting to remote motion events<br /&gtin this case).<br /&gtIf multichannel association is created the events are sent from motion sensor<br /&gtendpoint.</p&gt

Association group 2 supports 16 nodes.

### Group 3: Notification: Motion

Motion Begin/End
<p&gtGroup 3 sends MOTION\_BEGIN and MOTION\_END frames.<br /&gtMOTION\_BEGIN frame = Notification 0x07 (Home security) –<br /&gtMotion detection without location (0x08)<br /&gtMOTION\_END frame = Notification 0x07 (Home security) –<br /&gtEvent inactive (0x00, parameter 0x08)</p&gt <p&gtAfter the first motion detection, MOTION\_BEGIN is sent. If continual move-<br /&gtment is detected, MOTION\_BEGIN is sent every 1 minute repeatedly. When<br /&gtmotion ends, MOTION\_END is sent 5 seconds after the last motion detec-<br /&gttion.<br /&gtNotification to group 3 is sent only when NIGHT\_MODE = ON and MOTION\_<br /&gtENABLE = ON, regardless of LOCAL\_DISABLE state.<br /&gtAll devices in a group should have the same TIME settings in order that they<br /&gtswitch off at the same time.<br /&gtIf multichannel association is created the events are sent from motion sensor<br /&gtendpoint.</p&gt

Association group 3 supports 16 nodes.

### Group 4: Sensor: Luminescence

Ambient light
<p&gtAmbient Light via Group 4 is intended to substitute locally measured LUX<br /&gtvalues in target devices – so that the network can have one source of ambi-<br /&gtent light value. Frames are sent a maximum of once per 2.5 minutes and a<br /&gtminimum of once per 15 minutes.<br /&gtWhen device already uses remote Ambient Light value, then this value is also<br /&gtretransmitted to group 4.<br /&gtAll devices in such a group should have the same LIGHT (threshold) settings<br /&gtin order that night mode is detected at the same time.<br /&gtIf multichannel association is created the events are sent from light sensor<br /&gtendpoint.</p&gt

Association group 4 supports 15 nodes.
