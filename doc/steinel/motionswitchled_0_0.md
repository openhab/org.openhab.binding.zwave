  </tr>
</table>

  
**"Stupid" mode ( bit 2 = 1 ):**  
- has higher priority then slave mode.  
- LED is permanently on ( for simple power wall switch controlling ).

  
**Slave mode ( bit 0 = 1 ):**  
- only if included in Z-Wave network  
- useful for controlling via third-party sensor  
- LED is directly controlled via Z-Wave, internal sensors are not used for controlling it

  
**Central unit checking ( bit 1 = 1 ):** ( useful especially for controlling via gateway )  
When slave bit is 0:  
- device signalises fail of lifeline connection ( if this bit is zero, fail of lifeline connection  
is not signalised )  
When slave bit is 1:  
- device checks presence of Z-Wave device in lifeline group ( gateway ). If it is not  
present for 2 minutes ( testing repeatedly every 30 seconds ) device switches  
to normal mode in the same way as after the end of local disabled mode  
( ON_BEHAVIOUR )  
- the device checks every 1 minute for recovery of Lifeline connection.  
- if no lifeline specified - it works in normal mode

  
**Be careful with this option**, device stops using its own motion sensor in Slave  
and Stupid mode.This is an advanced parameter and will therefore not show in the user interface without entering advanced mode.

**Dim increase ( bit 0 ):**  
- long press of button does dim decreasing ( 0 = default )  
- long press of button does dim increasing ( 1 )

**Scene switch ( bit 1 ):**  
- short press of button does toggle - on/off ( 0 = default )  
- short press of button does scene switch ( 1 )

Values in the range 1 to 209 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```103```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_19_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The MotionSwitch LED supports 8 association groups.

### Group 0: ROOT DEVICE

Root

Association group 0 supports 1 node.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Lifeline
Lifeline messages  
- Device Reset Locally  
- Notifications:  
0x07 ( Home security ) - Motion Begin event ( 0x08 )  
0x07 ( Home security ) - Motion End event ( 0x00, 0x08 )  
- Binary Switch Report - LED state  
- Multilevel Sensor Report - value of internal ambient light sensor  
- Central scene notification - button events

Motion Begin and Motion End events are sent along with frames to group 3. If multichannel  
association is created the events are sent from motion sensor endpoint.  
Switch Report is sent immediately upon a change of status along with frames  
to group 2. If multichannel association is created the events are sent from LED  
endpoint.  
All notifications to lifeline are sent as sensor states regardless of sensor settings  
and states as SLAVE\_MODE, LOCAL\_DISABLED and MOTION_ENABLE.  
Multilevel Sensor Report is sent a maximum of once per 1 minute ( if the value has  
changed by at least 3% ) and a minimum of once per 15 minutes ( if the value has  
not changed ). If the ambient light value is old ( cannot be measured because of  
permanent light ), the value is not transmitted via lifeline. Multilevel Sensor Report  
can also be added to some other events to send in bulk. If multichannel association  
is created the events are sent from light sensor endpoint.  
Central scene notification is send as reaction to user interaction. If multichannel  
association is created the events are send from toogle button endpoint.

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: On/Off control

On/Off control
Group 2 is used for directly controlling Z-Wave devices via BASIC SET commands  
through the evaluation of movement and light, as with internal use ( so that all of  
these devices work together ). This is intended for use especially with third-party  
devices that do not implement reactions for motion events. BASIC_SET and  
similar Z-Wave commands are not retransmitted intentionally to slaves and must  
be sent to slave devices via the controlling device simultaneously. Only for use in  
master-slave system, multi-device control is not possible.  
Group 2 is evaluated and frames are transmitted there also in SLAVE_MODE, regardless  
of LOCAL\_DISABLED state and when MOTION\_ENABLE is off ( not using  
internal motion sensor, just reacting to remote motion events in this case ).  
If multichannel association is created the events are send from motion sensor  
endpoint.

Association group 2 supports 16 nodes.

### Group 3: Notification Report

Notification Report
Group 3 sends MOTION\_BEGIN and MOTION\_END frames.  
MOTION_BEGIN frame = Notification 0x07 ( Home security ) - Motion detection without location ( 0x08 )  
MOTION_END frame = Notification 0x07 ( Home security ) - Event inactive ( 0x00, parameter 0x08 )  
After the first motion detection, MOTION\_BEGIN is sent. If continual movement is detected, MOTION\_BEGIN is sent every 1 minute repeatedly. When motion ends, MOTION_END is sent 5 seconds after the last motion detection.  
Notification to group 3 is sent only when NIGHT\_MODE = ON and MOTION\_ENABLE = ON, regardless of LOCAL_DISABLE state.  
All devices in a group should have the same TIME settings in order that they switch  
off at the same time.  
If multichannel association is created the events are send from motion sensor  
endpoint.

Association group 3 supports 16 nodes.

### Group 4: Ambient light

Ambient light
Ambient Light via Group 4 is intended to substitute locally measured LUX values in target devices - so that the network can have one source of ambient light value.  
Frames are sent a maximum of once per 2.5 minutes and a minimum of once per 15 minutes.  
When device already uses remote Ambient light value, then this value is also retransmitted to group 4.  
All devices in such a group should have the same LIGHT ( threshold ) settings in order that night mode is detected at the same time.  
If multichannel association is created the events are send from light sensor endpoint.

Association group 4 supports 6 nodes.

### Group 5: Button on/off

Button on/off
Group 5 is used for directly controlling Z-Wave devices via BASIC SET commands by button. This function is allowed by default in cfg 17 ( BUTTON_BEHAVIOUR ).  
If multichannel association is created the events are sent from toggle button endpoint.

Association group 5 supports 16 nodes.

### Group 6: Button scene

Button scene
Group 6 is used for scene activation - switches from scene 1 to scene specified in cfg 18 ( BUTTON\_SCENES ) - increased by 1 - this function must be allowed in cfg 17 ( BUTTON\_BEHAVIOUR ). If multichannel association is created the events are sent from toggle button endpoint.

Association group 6 supports 16 nodes.

### Group 7: Button dim

Button dim
Group 7 is used for dimming ( use just for multilevel lamps ). This function is allowed by default in cfg 17 ( BUTTON_BEHAVIOUR ).  
If multichannel association is created the events are sent from toggle button endpoint.

Association group 7 supports 16 nodes.
