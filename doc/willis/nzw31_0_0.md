The NZW31 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
An association command class that allows the device to communicate with other Z-Wave devices directly -- such as sending BASIC REPORT whenever the switch is turned on or off.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.
