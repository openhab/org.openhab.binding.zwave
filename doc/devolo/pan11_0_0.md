The PAN11 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

This plug-in ON/OFF switch PAN11 is a security enabled wireless switch, based on Z-Wave Plus technology.

Remote On/Off control of the connected load is possible with other manufacturer’s wireless Controller. Each switch is designed to act as a repeater. Repeaters will re-transmit the RF signal to ensure that the signal is received by its intended destination by routing the signal around obstacles and radio dead spots. Because PAN11 supports Security Command Class, it can learn with Secured controller. Its functionality and supported command classes is identical when included as a secure and non-secure device.

### Inclusion Information

Pressing On/Off button three times within 2 seconds will enter inclusion mode.

### Exclusion Information

Pressing On/Off button three times within 2 seconds will enter exclusion mode.
