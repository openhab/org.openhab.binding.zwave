# MT2759 Home Control Wall Mounted Switch
This describes the Z-Wave device *MT2759*, manufactured by *Devolo* with the thing type UID of ```devolo_mt2759_00_000```.

The device is in the category of *Wall Switch*, defining Any device attached to the wall that controls a binary status of something, for ex. a light switch.

![MT2759 product image](https://opensmarthouse.org/zwavedatabase/1107/image/)


The MT2759 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

This Z-Wave module is used for switching on or off the electrical device (e.g. light or fan). The module operates on 868,4 MHz. The module can be controlled either through Z-wave network or through the wall switch. The module is designed to be mounted inside a “flush mounting box”, hidden behind a traditional wall switch. Module measures power consumption of electrical device and supports connection of digital temperature sensor. It is designed to act as repeater in order to improve range and stability of Z-wave network.

# Supported switches

Module supports mono stable switches (push button) and bi stable switches. The module is factory set to operate with bi stable switches.

### Inclusion Information

# Module Inclusion (Adding to Z-wave network)

  * Connect module to power supply (with temperature sensor connected if purchased*),
  * enable add/remove mode on main controller
  * auto inclusion (works for about 2 minutes after connected to power supply) or
  * press push button I1 three times within 5 s (3 times change switch state within 5 seconds) or
  * press service button S (only applicable for 24 V SELVsupply voltage) for more than 2 second

  
NOTE 1: For auto inclusion procedure, first set main controller into inclusion mode and then connect module to power supply.  
NOTE 2: When connecting temperature sensor to module that has already been included, you have to exclude module first. Switch off power supply, connect the sensor and re include the module.

### Exclusion Information

Module Exclusion/Reset (Removing from Z-Wave network)

  * Connect module to power supply
  * bring module within maximum 1 meter (3 feet) of the main controller,
  * enable add/remove mode on main controller
  * press push button I1 five times within 5 s (5 times change switch state within 5 seconds) in the first 60 seconds after the module is  connected to the power supply or
  * press service button S (only applicable for 24 V SELV supply voltage) for more than 6 seconds.

By this function all parameters of the module are set to default values and own ID is deleted.

Please use this procedure only when the network primary controller is missing or otherwise inoperable.

If push button I1 is pressed three times within 5 s (or service button S is pressed more than 2 and less than 6 seconds) module is excluded, but configuration parameters are not set to default values.

NOTE: If the module is included with parameters 100 or 101 with values different to default and module reset is done, wait at least 30s before next inclusion.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The MT2759 supports 9 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Lifeline group (reserved for communication with the main controller), 1 node allowed.

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Basic On/Off I1

basic on/off (triggered at change of the output Q state and reflecting its state) up to 16 nodes.

Association group 2 supports 16 nodes.

### Group 3: Basic On/Off I2

basic on/off (triggered at change of the input I2 state and reflecting its state) up to 16 nodes.

Association group 3 supports 16 nodes.

### Group 4: Reporting I2

Notification report (triggered at change of the input I2 state and reflecting its state) up to 16 nodes.

Association group 4 supports 16 nodes.

### Group 5: Binary Sensor Report I2

Binary sensor (triggered at change of the input I2 state and reflecting its state) up to 16 nodes.

Association group 5 supports 16 nodes.

### Group 6: Basic On/Off I3

basic on/off (triggered at change of the input I3 state an d reflecting its state) up to 16 nodes.
