# FGKF601 Keyfob
This describes the Z-Wave device *FGKF601*, manufactured by *[Fibargroup](http://www.fibaro.com/)* with the thing type UID of ```fibaro_fgkf601_00_000```.

The device is in the category of *Remote Control*, defining Any portable or hand-held device that controls the status of something, e.g. remote control, keyfob etc..

![FGKF601 product image](https://opensmarthouse.org/zwavedatabase/542/image/)


The FGKF601 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The FGKF601 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

  * 30 different actions, single/double/triple click, hold for each button and sequences,
  * Easy to operate menu,
  * Actions are confirmed by the built-in LED diode.

# Basic activation

  1. Using included keyring or a coin, open the battery cover by turning it counter-clockwise
  2. Remove the sticker protecting the battery.
  3. Using included keyring or a coin, close the battery cover by turning it clockwise.
  4. Locate the device nearby the main Z-Wave controller.
  5. Set the main Z-Wave controller in (Security/non-Security Mode) add mode (see the controller’s manual).
  6. Click any button three times.
  7. LED will pulse white during the adding process.
  8. Wait for the device to be added into the system.
  9. Successful adding will be confirmed by the Z-Wave controller’s message and green LED colour.

### Inclusion Information

  1. Set the main Z-Wave controller in (Security/non-Security Mode) add mode (see the controller’s manual).
  2. Power the device (insert the battery).
  3. Click any button three times.
  4. LED will pulse white during the adding process.
  5. Wait for the adding process to end.
  6. Successful adding will be confirmed by the Z-Wave controller’s message and green LED colour.

### Exclusion Information

### Wakeup Information

The FGKF601 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


The KeyFob needs to be woken up to receive information about the new configuration from the Z-Wave controller, like parameters and associations. Use 1st menu position (white) or click o and + simultaneously to wake up the device.

### General Usage Information

# Menu allows to perform Z-Wave network actions. In order to use the menu:

  1. Click o and - simultaneously.
  2. Click Δ or x until LED indicates desired menu position with colour: 
      * White - wake up the device
      * Green - learning mode (adding/removing)
      * Cyan - check battery level
      * Yellow - reset the device*
  3. Click + to confirm selection, Click - to exit the menu.
  4. LED will pulse twice with same colour as selected menu position to confirm completing action.

# Resetting the device to factory defaults:

  
Reset procedure allows to restore the device back to its factory settings, which means all information about the Z-Wave controller and  
user configuration will be deleted. There are two ways of resetting the device:

Resetting the device using the menu:

  1. Click o and - simultaneously.
  2. Click Δ or x until LED glows yellow.
  3. Click +.

Emergency resetting the device on start-up:

  1. Remove the battery.
  2. Hold □ and + , while inserting the battery.

Successful resetting will be confirmed by smoothly brightening and dimming of the yellow LED colour.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the FGKF601 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Scene Number | scene_number | scene_number |  | Number | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | system.battery_level | Battery | Number |

### Scene Number
Triggers when a scene button is pressed.

The ```scene_number``` channel is of type ```scene_number``` and supports the ```Number``` item.
This channel provides the scene, and the event as a decimal value in the form ```<scene>.<event>```. The scene number is set by the device, and the event is as follows -:

| Event ID | Event Description  |
|----------|--------------------|
| 0        | Single key press   |
| 1        | Key released       |
| 2        | Key held down      |
| 3        | Double keypress    |
| 4        | Tripple keypress   |
| 5        | 4 x keypress       |
| 6        | 5 x keypress       |

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The FGKF601 supports 13 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
“Lifeline” reports the device status and allows for assigning single device only (main controller by default).

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Square - On/Off

“Square - On/Off” is assigned to clicking the □ button and is used to turn on/off associated devices.

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.
