### Inclusion Information

Add (inclusion) – the Z-Wave device learning mode allows you to add the device to the existing Z-Wave network.

Manually adding the device to the Z-Wave network

  1. Turn on the device. If the device has not been added to the Z-Wave network, the LED indicator of the device will light up red.
  2. Set the main control unit to the Security/Non-Safety Additional mode (see the ECU manual for more information).
  3. Quickly click the PROG button on the device three times. Alternatively, you can click on S1 or S2 three times.
  4. If you add the device in Security S2 Authenticated mode, enter the PIN code specified on the device. The PIN code is also a underlined part of the device-specific key (DSK) specified at the bottom of the field.
  5. Wait until the LED indicator flashes yellow.
  6. Successful adding is confirmed by the reporting of the Z-Wave controller and the LED display of the device:

Green – successful (not secure, S0, S2 not authenticated)

Magenta – successful (Safety S2 authenticated)

Red – not successful

  


Adding the device to the Z-Wave network with SmartStart

SmartStart solution allows you to add products to the Z-Wave network by scanning the Z-Wave QR code located on the product, with a controller that enables SmartStart integration. A SmartStart product is automatically included in the network area within 10 minutes of turning it on.

iTo use SmartStart, your ECU must support Security S2 mode (see the control unit's manual for more information).

  1. Enter the full DSK string code in your ECU. If your ECU supports a QR scan, scan the QR code on the label.
  2. Supply the device with power (on switch on the mains voltage).
  3. The LED indicator starts to flash yellow. Wait until the addition process is finished.
  4. Successful adding is confirmed by the reporting of the Z-Wave controller and the LED display of the device:

Green – successful (not secure, S0, S2 not authenticated)

Magenta – successful (Safety S2 authenticated)

Red – not successful

if you have any problems adding the device, please reset it and repeat the process.

### Exclusion Information

Remove (exclude) – the Z-Wave device learning mode makes it possible to remove the device from the existing Z Wave network.

  1. Make sure the device is turned on
  2. Switch the main controller to the removal mode (see the controller's operating instructions for more information).
  3. Quickly click the PROG button three times. Alternatively, you can click S1 or S2 three times within 10 minutes after turning on the device.
  4. Wait until the removal process is finished.
  5. The successful removal is confirmed by a reporting from the Z-Wave controller. The LED indicator lights red.

Removing the device from the Z-Wave network does not result in a factory reset.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The FGR224 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
General: Lifeline
1st association group – “Lifeline” reports the device status and allows for assigning single device only (main controller by default).

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Window Covering

Control: KEY01 (0x20: 0x01)
2nd association group – “Window Covering” is intended for curtains or blinds allowing the user to control the amount of light going through windows.

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.
