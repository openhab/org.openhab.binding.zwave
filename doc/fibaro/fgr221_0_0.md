The FGR221 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

The in-wall Roller Shutter Controller is hereinafter referred to as Fibaro Roller Controller. It is designed to switch rise/lower roller shutter connected to its terminals using radio waves, controllers and a push button directly connected to Fibaro Roller Controller. 

### Inclusion Information

Add the Roller Shutter Controller to the network by pushing three times key no. 1 or push-button B located inside the housing of the device. 

# NOTE:

It should be noted that after proper adding the Roller Shutter Controller to the Fibaro System, it should be calibrated. The calibration process involves performing two complete cycles of opening/ closing the shutter. Properly completed calibration may be verified by setting required position of the shutter using the icon e.g. 30% of shutter opening - the actual opening should correspond to this value/position.

For large Z-WAVE networks it is recommended to calibrate the module by switches connected to S1 and S2 inputs. 

### Exclusion Information

Within 5 sec. after connecting mains voltage supply, the Roller Shutter Controller allows the user to reset settings by pressing once S1 key and then holding key S2
