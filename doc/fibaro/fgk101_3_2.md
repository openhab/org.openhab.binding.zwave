# FGK101 Door Opening Sensor
This describes the Z-Wave device *FGK101*, manufactured by *[Fibargroup](http://www.fibaro.com/)* with the thing type UID of ```fibaro_fgk101_03_002```.
This version of the device is limited to firmware versions above 3.2

The device is in the category of *Door*, defining Door sensors.

The FGK101 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The FGK101 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

**FIBARO Door/Window Sensor** is a wireless, battery powered reed sensor compatible with the Z-Wave standard. Changing the device’s status will automatically send signal to the Z-Wave controller and associated devices. 

Sensor can be used to trigger scenes and everywhere there is a need for information about opening or closing of doors, windows, garage doors, etc. Opening is detected by separating the sensor’s body and the magnet.

In addition the FIBARO Door/Window Sensor supports one DS18B20 temperature sensor and has one potential free input.

### Inclusion Information

Quickly, three times press the TMP button. 

### Exclusion Information

Quickly, three times press the TMP button. 

### Wakeup Information

The FGK101 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


To wake up the sensor manually, click one of the TMP buttons (while the other button is pressed).

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the FGK101 -:

The manufacturer defined default value is ```15```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_72_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The FGK101 supports 5 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Control


Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Alarm


Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 4: Sensor ZW3


Association group 4 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 5: Tamper ZW3


Association group 5 supports 5 nodes.
