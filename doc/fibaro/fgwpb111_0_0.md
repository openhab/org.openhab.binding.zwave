## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The FGWPB-111 supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
reports the device status and allows for assigning single device only

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: OnOffButton

devices in this group will be switched on or off when relay status is changed using the but- ton

Association group 2 supports 50 nodes.

### Group 3: OnOffPlugPower

devices in this group will be switched on or off depending on the current load of plugged device (uses Basic command class).

Association group 3 supports 50 nodes.
