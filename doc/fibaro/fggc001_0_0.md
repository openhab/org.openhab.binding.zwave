## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The FGGC001 supports 6 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline


This group supports 1 nodes.

### Group 2: Flick up gesture


This group supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Flick down gesture


This group supports 5 nodes.

### Group 4: Flick left gesture


This group supports 5 nodes.

### Group 5: Flick right gesture


This group supports 5 nodes.
