The FGCD001 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The FGCD001 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

<p&gtFIBARO CO Sensor is an ultra-light, compact, battery-powered carbon monoxide detector, designed to be placed on a wall. Its high sensitivity allows to detect the presence of the carbon monoxide (CO) gas at the early stage in order to prevent carbon monoxide poisoning.</p&gt

### Inclusion Information

<p&gtQuickly, triple click the button located on the casing.</p&gt

### Exclusion Information

<p&gtQuickly, triple click the button located on the casing.</p&gt

### Wakeup Information

The FGCD001 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


<p&gtTo wake up the sensor manually click the button located on the casing.</p&gt

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The FGCD001 supports 7 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
“Lifeline” reports the device status and allows for assigning single device only (main controller by default).
<p&gtThe device provides the association of six groups: 1st association group – “Lifeline” reports the device status and allows for assigning single device only (main controller by default).</p&gt <p&gt“LifeLine” group is reserved solely for the controller and hence only 1 node can be assigned. It is not recommended to associate more than 10 devices in general, as the response time to control commands depends on the number of associated devices. In extreme cases, system response may be delayed.</p&gt <p&gtNotification report: The device uses Notification Command Class to report different events to 1st association group (Lifeline).</p&gt <table&gt<tr&gt<td&gtNotification Type</td&gt <td&gtTriggering Event</td&gt </tr&gt<tr&gt<td&gtCO Alarm</td&gt <td&gt <p&gt1. Carbon monoxide detected, unknown location <br /&gt2. Carbon monoxide test<br /&gt3. Replacement required </p&gt </td&gt </tr&gt<tr&gt<td&gtHeat Alarm</td&gt <td&gtOverheat detected, unknown location</td&gt </tr&gt<tr&gt<td&gtHome Security</td&gt <td&gtTampering, product covering removed</td&gt </tr&gt<tr&gt<td&gtPower Management</td&gt <td&gtReplace battery soon </td&gt </tr&gt<tr&gt<td&gtSystem</td&gt <td&gtSystem hardware failure</td&gt </tr&gt</table&gt

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: CO Alarm Status

Devices in this group will be switched on/off when CO Alarm status changes.
<p&gt2nd association group – “CO Alarm” is assigned to the device status - devices in this group will be switched on/off when CO Alarm status changes.</p&gt <p&gtThe CO Sensor in 2nd to 7th group allows to control 5 regular or multichannel devices per an association group.</p&gt <p&gtIt is not recommended to associate more than 10 devices in general, as the response time to control commands depends on the number of associated devices. In extreme cases, system response may be delayed.</p&gt

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: CO Alarm

Devices in this group will receive notification when CO Alarm status changes.
<p&gt3rd association group – “CO Alarm” is assigned to the device status - devices in this group will receive notification when CO Alarm status changes. Useful for devices that can trigger alarms.</p&gt <p&gtThe CO Sensor in 2nd to 7th group allows to control 5 regular or multichannel devices per an association group. </p&gt <p&gtIt is not recommended to associate more than 10 devices in general, as the response time to control commands depends on the number of associated devices. In extreme cases, system response may be delayed.</p&gt

Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 4: CO Level

Devices in this group will be switched on/off after exceeding the level of CO concentration specified in parameter 14.
<p&gt4th association group – “CO Level” is assigned to measured CO level - devices in this group will be switched on/off after exceeding the level of CO concentration specified in parameter 14.</p&gt <p&gtThe CO Sensor in 2nd to 7th group allows to control 5 regular or multichannel devices per an association group. </p&gt <p&gtIt is not recommended to associate more than 10 devices in general, as the response time to control commands depends on the number of associated devices. In extreme cases, system response may be delayed.</p&gt

Association group 4 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 5: Tamper Alarm

Sends tamper alarm and cancellation frames to the associated devices.
<p&gt5th association group – “Tamper Alarm” is assigned to the tamper - sends tamper alarm and cancellation frames to the associated devices.</p&gt <p&gtThe CO Sensor in 2nd to 7th group allows to control 5 regular or multichannel devices per an association group. </p&gt <p&gtIt is not recommended to associate more than 10 devices in general, as the response time to control commands depends on the number of associated devices. In extreme cases, system response may be delayed. </p&gt

Association group 5 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 6: CO Alarm BC

Devices in this group will receive sensor alarm frames when CO Alarm status changes.
<p&gt6th association group – “CO Alarm BC” is assigned to the device status - devices in this group will receive sensor alarm frames when CO Alarm status changes. Provides backward compatibility with controllers not supporting Z-Wave+ protocol.</p&gt <p&gtThe CO Sensor in 2nd to 7th group allows to control 5 regular or multichannel devices per an association group. </p&gt <p&gtIt is not recommended to associate more than 10 devices in general, as the response time to control commands depends on the number of associated devices. In extreme cases, system response may be delayed.</p&gt

Association group 6 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 7: Tamper Alarm BC

Sends tamper alarm and alarm cancellation frames to the associated devices.
<p&gt7th association group – “Tamper Alarm BC” is assigned to the tamper - sends tamper alarm and alarm cancellation frames to the associated devices.
