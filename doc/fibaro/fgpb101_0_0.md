The FGPB101 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The FGPB101 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

<p&gtFIBARO Button is a compact, battery-powered, Z-Wave Plus compatible device. It allows you to control devices through the Z-Wave network and run various scenes defined in FIBARO System.</p&gt <p&gtDifferent actions may be triggered with one to five clicks or by holding the button down. In panic mode, each press of the button results in triggering the FIBARO Alarm.</p&gt <p&gtWith its small design and wireless communication, the FIBARO Button can be conveniently mounted on any surface and in any position or location at home, e.g. beside the bed or under the desk.</p&gt <p&gtMain features of FIBARO Button:</p&gt <ul&gt<li&gtCompatible with any Z-Wave or Z-Wave+ Controller</li&gt <li&gtSupports Z-Wave network Security Mode with AES-128 encryption</li&gt <li&gtCompletely wireless with battery power and Z-Wave communication</li&gt <li&gtMay be installed anywhere in your home</li&gt <li&gtExtremely easy installation - simply add and put on desired surface</li&gt <li&gtMany colour variations: black, white, red, green, blue, yellow, orange and brown.</li&gt </ul&gt

### Inclusion Information

<p&gtAdding (Inclusion) - Z-Wave device learning mode, allowing to add the device to existing Z-Wave network.</p&gt <p&gtTo add the device to the Z-Wave network:</p&gt <ol&gt<li&gtPlace the Button within the direct range of your Z-Wave controller.</li&gt <li&gtSet the main controller in (Security/non-Security) add mode (see the controller’s manual).</li&gt <li&gtClick the Button at least six times.</li&gt <li&gtWait for the adding process to end.</li&gt <li&gtSuccessful adding will be confirmed by the Z-Wave controller’s message.</li&gt </ol&gt

### Exclusion Information

<p&gtRemoving (Exclusion) - Z-Wave device learning mode, allowing to remove the device from existing Z-Wave network.</p&gt <p&gtTo remove the device to the Z-Wave network:</p&gt <ol&gt<li&gtPlace the Button within the direct range of your Z-Wave controller.</li&gt <li&gtSet the main controller in remove mode (see the controller’s manual).</li&gt <li&gtClick the Button at least six times.</li&gt <li&gtWait for the removing process to end.</li&gt <li&gtSuccessful removing will be confirmed by the Z-Wave controller’s message.</li&gt </ol&gt

### Wakeup Information

The FGPB101 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


<p&gtThe Button needs to be woken up to receive information about the new configuration from the controller, like parameters and associations. Click the Button 4 times to wake it up.</p&gt

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the FGPB101 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Scene Number | scene_number | scene_number |  | Number | 
| Alarm | alarm_general | alarm_general | Alarm | Switch | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | system.battery_level | Battery | Number |

### Scene Number
Triggers when a scene button is pressed.

The ```scene_number``` channel is of type ```scene_number``` and supports the ```Number``` item.
This channel provides the scene, and the event as a decimal value in the form ```<scene>.<event>```. The scene number is set by the device, and the event is as follows -:

| Event ID | Event Description  |
|----------|--------------------|
| 0        | Single key press   |
| 1        | Key released       |
| 2        | Key held down      |
| 3        | Double keypress    |
| 4        | Tripple keypress   |
| 5        | 4 x keypress       |
| 6        | 5 x keypress       |

### Alarm
Indicates if an alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_general``` channel is of type ```alarm_general``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Alarm``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The FGPB101 supports 4 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
reports the device status and allows for assigning single device only (main controller by default)

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: On/Off

assigned to clicking the button and is used to turn on/off associated devices

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Dimmer

is assigned to holding the button and is used to change level of associated devices

Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 4: Alarm

assigned to clicking and/or holding the button (triggers are defined in parameter 30) and is used to send alarm frames to associated devices

Association group 4 supports 5 nodes.
