## Association Groups
Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The FGPB101 supports 4 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline
reports the device status and allows for assigning single device only (main controller by default)
This group supports 1 nodes.

### Group 2: On/Off
assigned to clicking the button and is used to turn on/off associated devices
This group supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Dimmer
is assigned to holding the button and is used to change level of associated devices
This group supports 5 nodes.

### Group 4: Alarm
assigned to clicking and/or holding the button (triggers are defined in parameter 30) and is used to send alarm frames to associated devices
This group supports 5 nodes.
