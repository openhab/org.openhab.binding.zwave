## Overview

<p&gtFIBARO Wall Plug is a universal, Z-Wave Plus compatible, remotely controlled outlet adapter. This device may be applied wherever you want to control electrical devices with up to 2500W load.<br /&gt<br /&gtThe Wall Plug is equipped with a power and energy metering function. It uses a LED ring to visualize the current load with colour changing illumination and operating mode. This is the smallest and most attractive device of this type available in the world.<br /&gt<br /&gtThe Wall Plug may be operated using the B-button located on its casing or via any Z-Wave compatible controller.</p&gt

### Inclusion Information

<p&gtTo add the device to the Z-Wave network:<br /&gt<br /&gt    Plug the device into a socket nearby the main Z-Wave controller.<br /&gt    The LED ring will glow red signalling not being added (reset or remove the device otherwise).<br /&gt    Set the main controller in (security/non-security) add mode (see the controller’s manual).<br /&gt    Quickly, triple click the B-button located on the casing.<br /&gt    Wait for the adding process to end.<br /&gt    Successful adding will be confirmed by the Z-Wave controller’s message.</p&gt

### Exclusion Information

<p&gtTo remove the device from the Z-Wave network:<br /&gt<br /&gt    Plug the device into a socket nearby the main Z-Wave controller.<br /&gt    The LED ring will glow green signalling being added (removing is not necessary otherwise).<br /&gt    Set the main controller into remove mode (see the controller’s manual).<br /&gt    Quickly, triple click the B-button located on the casing.<br /&gt    Wait for the removing process to end.<br /&gt    Successful removing will be confirmed by the Z-Wave controller’s message.</p&gt

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The FGWP101 supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Group 1 (on/off controlled devices)

<p&gtIs assigned to the device status – sending command frames to the associated devices whenever the Wall Plug is turned ON or OFF via B-button.</p&gt <p&gtFibaro Association Group Info</p&gt <p&gtAllows to control 5 regular and 5 multichannel devices per an association group.</p&gt

Association group 1 supports 10 nodes.

### Group 2: Group 2 (measured load controlled devices)

<p&gtIs assigned to the measured active power – sending command frames to the associated devices depending on the measured load (configured via advanced parameters 50, 51 and 52).</p&gt <p&gtFibaro Association Group Info</p&gt <p&gtAllows to control 5 regular and 5 multichannel devices per an association group.</p&gt

Association group 2 supports 10 nodes.

### Group 3: Controller Updates

<p&gtReports the device status and allows to assign single device only (the main controller by default).</p&gt <p&gtFibaro Association Group Info</p&gt <p&gt3rd group is reserved solely for the controller and hence only 1 node can be assigned.</p&gt

Association group 3 supports 1 node.
