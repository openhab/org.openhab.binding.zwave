## Overview

FIBARO Walli Double Switch is a smart wall switch designed to control one or two light sources via Z-Wave network. It measures active power and energy consumed by the controlled load. You can install it with provided cover plate or other compatible.   
Main features of FIBARO Walli Double Switch: 

Can be used with:

  * Conventional incandescent and halogen light sources,
  * LED lamps,
  * Fluorescent lamps,
  * Electronic transformers (for ELV halogen lamps and LED bulbs),
  * Ferromagnetic transformers (for MLV halogen lamps).
  * Can be used with provided cover plate or one of the following: 
      * GIRA – System 55 (Standard 55, E2, Event, Event Clear), 
      * Legrand – Céliane, 
      * Schneider – Odace.
      * Active power and energy consumption metering.
  * Supports Z-Wave network Security Modes: S0 with AES-128 encryption and S2 Authenticated with PRNG-based encryption. 
  * Works as Z-Wave signal repeater (all non-battery operated devices within the network will act as repeaters to increase reliability of the network). 
  * May be used with all devices certified with the Z-Wave Plus certificate and should be compatible with such devices produced by other manufacturers. 

### Inclusion Information

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The FGWDSEU supports 5 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
1st association group – “Lifeline” reports the device status and allows for assigning single device only (main controller by default).

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: ON/OFF (1)

2nd association group – “On/Off (1)” is used to turn the associated devices on/off reflecting button operation for 1st channel (uses Basic command class).

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Dimmer (1)

3rd association group – “Dimmer (1)” is used to change level of associated devices reflecting button operation for 1st channel (uses Switch Multilevel command class).

Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 4: ON/OFF (2)

4th association group* – “On/Off (2)” is used to turn the associated devices on/off reflecting button operation for 2nd channel (uses Basic command class).

Association group 4 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 5: Dimmer (2)

5th association group* – “Dimmer (2)” is used to change level of associated devices reflecting button operation for 2nd channel (uses Switch Multilevel command class).

Association group 5 supports 5 nodes.
