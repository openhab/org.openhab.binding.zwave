### General Usage Information

#  
7: Operating the device

  
7.1: Controlling channels with inputs  
  
Momentary switch (parameter 20 set to 0):  
  
1x click – change the state of the channel to the opposite one  
  
Toggle switch without memory (parameter 20 set to 1):  
  
1x switch – change the state of the channel to the state of the switch (OFF if contacts opened, ON if contacts closed)  
  
Toggle switch with memory (parameter 20 set to 2):  
  
1x switch – change the state of the channel to the opposite one  
  
By default S1 input controls 1st channel and S2 input controls 2nd channel if present. It can be changed using parameters 24 and 25.  
  
By default outputs are set as NO (normally open).  It means the contacts will be opened when turned off and closed when turned on. It can be switched to NC (normally closed), which means the contacts will be closed when turned off and opened when turned on using parameters 162/163.  
  
7.2: Visual indications

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The FGS214 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Device status and al-lows for assigning single device only
1st association group – “Lifeline” reports the device status and al-lows for assigning single device only (main controller by default).

Association group 1 supports 10 nodes.

### Group 2: On/Off

Turn the associated devices on/off
2nd association group –  “On/Off” is used to turn the associated devices on/off reflecting input operation (uses Basic command class).

Association group 2 supports 10 nodes.
