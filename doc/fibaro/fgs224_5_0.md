# FGS224 Fibaro Double Smart Module
This describes the Z-Wave device *FGS224*, manufactured by *[Fibargroup](http://www.fibaro.com/)* with the thing type UID of ```fibaro_fgs224_05_000```.
This version of the device is limited to firmware version 5.0

The device is in the category of *Wall Switch*, defining Any device attached to the wall that controls a binary status of something, for ex. a light switch.

![FGS224 product image](https://opensmarthouse.org/zwavedatabase/1275/image/)


The FGS224 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

# Description

The remotely operated FIBARO Smart Module and Double Smart Module are designed to turn electrical devices or circuits on and off. Smart Module allows to control one device or circuit and the Double Smart Module allows to control two devices or circuits. The compact size of the device allows for the product to be installed in the housings of other devices. The devices can be controlled either via the Z-Wave™ network or with buttons connected directly to them.

# Main features

  * Works with various types of switches and buttons.
  * Supports Z-Wave network Security Modes: S0 with AES-128 encryption and S2 Authenticated with PRNG-based encryption.
  * Works as a Z-Wave signal repeater
  * May be used with all devices certified with the Z-Wave Plus™ certificate and should be compatible with such devices produced by other manufacturers.

### Inclusion Information

To add the device to the Z-Wave network manually:

  1. Quickly, three times click button connected to S1/S2 or the maintenance button.
  2. LED will start blinking yellow, wait for the adding process to end.
  3. Adding result will be confirmed by the Z-Wave controller’s message and the LED: 
      * Green – successful (non-secure, S0, S2 non-authenticated),
      * Magenta – successful (Security S2 Authenticated),
      * Red – not successful. 

### Exclusion Information

**Note:** Removing also results in resetting the device to factory defaults. Make sure that restoring the parameters to factory defaults will not result in damaging the connected device, we recommend disconnecting it first.

  1. Quickly, three times click the maintenance button.
  2. LED will start blinking yellow, wait for the removing process to end.
  3. Successful removing will be confirmed by the Z-Wave controller’s message and red LED colour.

### General Usage Information

# Controlling channels with inputs Momentary switch (parameter 20 set to 0):

  * 1x click – change the state of the channel to the opposite one Toggle switch without memory (parameter 20 set to 1):
  * 1x switch – change the state of the channel to the state of the switch (OFF if contacts opened, ON if contacts closed) Toggle switch with memory (parameter 20 set to 2):
  * 1x switch – change the state of the channel to the opposite one

By default S1 input controls 1st channel and S2 input controls 2nd channel if present. It can be changed using parameters 24 and 25.

By default outputs are set as NO (normally open). It means the contacts will be opened when turned off and closed when turned on. It can be switched to NC (normally closed), which means the contacts will be closed when turned off and opened when turned on using parameters 162/163.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The FGS224 supports 3 association groups.

### Group 0: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
reports the device status and allows for assigning single device only (main controller by default).
1st association group – “Lifeline” reports the device status and allows for assigning single device only (main controller by default).

Association group 0 supports 1 node.

### Group 1: On/Off (1)

is used to turn the associated devices on/off reflecting input operation for 1st channel (uses Basic command class).
2nd association group – “On/Off (1)” is used to turn the associated devices on/off reflecting input operation for 1st channel (uses Basic command class).

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: On/Off (2)

is used to turn the associated devices on/off reflecting input operation for 2nd channel (uses Basic command class).
3rd association group – “On/Off (2)” is used to turn the associated devices on/off reflecting input operation for 2nd channel (uses Basic command class).

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.
