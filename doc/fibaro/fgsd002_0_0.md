## Association Groups
Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The FGSD002 supports 5 association groups.

### Group 1: Device Status

This group supports 1 nodes.

### Group 2: Battery capacity low

This group supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Tamper Alarm

This group supports 5 nodes.

### Group 4: Fire Alarm

This group supports 5 nodes.

### Group 5: Tamper Alarm

This group supports 5 nodes.
