| 1 | Upload the difference value only |
| 2 | Timing upload mode only |
| 3 | Upload the difference+timing upload mode |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```3``` (Upload the difference+timing upload mode).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: Upload the difference

Upload the difference
Base on 0.1C unit. 5 by default. 5 * 0.1C = 0.5C, 0x0003 to 0x03E8
Values in the range 3 to 1000 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```5```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 4: Upload time interval regularly

Upload time interval in seconds (10-65535)
Base is 1s unit. It is suggested to be set above 30s, 0x000A to 0xFFFF
Values in the range 10 to 65535 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```30```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_4_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 255: Factory Setting

Factory Setting

Values in the range 0 to 85 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_255_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The MH8-FC supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
For sending temperature, working mode, notifications, etc.

Association group 1 supports 1 node.
