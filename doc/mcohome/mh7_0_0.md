The MH7 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

MCOHome Water / Electrical Heating Thermostat is a Z-Wave enabled device for indoor temperature control. MH7-WH-EU is mainly applied to control wall mounted boiler, water valve/pump etc. , while MH7-EH-EU for electrical heating system. The device is of high reliability and practicability. And can be included and operated in any Z-Wave network with other Z-Wave certified devices from any other manufacturers

### Inclusion Information

  * Under the shutdown state, press & hold S2 to enter interface for inclusion or exclusion of Z-Wave network.  Before device included into network, “\- - -” will display on the screen.
  * Then press S4 once, device will enter learning mode to get a node ID.

If inclusion is success, a node ID will display on the screen in a few seconds.

After inclusion, turn off the device and then turn it on. Now the device is ready to be operated by controller/ gateway in Z-Wave network.

### Exclusion Information

  * Under the shutdown state, press & hold S2 to enter interface for inclusion or exclusion of Z-Wave network.  
  * Then press S4 once, device will enter learning mode.

If exclusion is success, “\- - -”  will display on the screen in a few seconds.

## Device Configuration

The device has no configuration parameters defined.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The MH7 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Gateway

For sending temperature, working mode, etc. notifications

Association group 1 supports 1 node.
