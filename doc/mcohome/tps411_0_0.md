## Overview

**Touch Panel Switch** is a wall panel built-in with Z-Wave Plus module. With its stylish design and stable performance, the panel can be used to control house-hold electrical appliances like lamp, motor, coffee machine, TV set etc. It supports basic command class，multi channel command class and multi channel association command class, also works as a repeater in a Z-Wave network. This product can be included and operated in any Z-Wave network with other Z-Wave certified devices from any other manufacturers

### Inclusion Information

On factory default the device does not belong to any Z-Wave network. The device needs to be **added to an existing wireless network** to communicate with the devices of this network. This process is called **Inclusion**.

To include the device you only need to press and hold any key for 8 seconds.

### Exclusion Information

Devices can also be removed from a network. This process is called **Exclusion**. Both processes are initiated by the primary controller of the Z-Wave network. This controller is turned into exclusion respective inclusion mode. Inclusion and Exclusion is then performed doing a special manual action right on the device.

To exclude the device you only need to press and hold any key for 3 seconds.

### General Usage Information

The actuator is operated by the local switching Touch pannels or wirelessly using Z-Wave commands.

In order to include (add) a Z-Wave device to a network it **must be in factory default state.** Please make sure to reset the device into factory default. You can do this by performing an Exclusion operation as described below in the manual. Every Z-Wave controller is able to perform this operation however it is recommended to use the primary controller of the previous network to make sure the very device is excluded properly from this network.

#### Reset to factory default

This device also allows to be reset without any involvement of a Z-Wave controller. This procedure should only be used when the primary controller is inoperable.

  * Press and hold any key on the panel for 10 seconds for restoring factory settings.
