## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The MH-P311 supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
1st AG: reports device’s dimming state. It supports only one Node ID. A controller/gateway SHOULD be associated to this AG.

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Basic Set Command

Basic Set Command
2nd AG: to control the associated devices synchronously. When S1’s state changes, it will send “Basic Set Command” to these devices. It supports upto 5 Node IDs.

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Multi-level Set Command

AG: to control the associated devices synchronously. When S1’s state changes, it will send

“Multi-level Set Command” to these devices. It supports upto 5 Node IDs.

Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.
