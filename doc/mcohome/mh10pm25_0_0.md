## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the MCOHOME MH10-PM2.5-WA/WD -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Sensor (PARTICULATE_MATTER) | sensor_particulate | sensor_particulate |  | Number | 
| Sensor (relative humidity) | sensor_relhumidity | sensor_relhumidity | Humidity | Number | 
| Sensor (temperature) | sensor_temperature | sensor_temperature | Temperature | Number:Temperature | 

### Sensor (PARTICULATE_MATTER)
PM2.5 refers to atmospheric particulate matter (PM) that have a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometers, which is about 3% the diameter of a human hair.

Commonly written as PM<sub>2.5</sub>, particles in this category are so small that they can only be detected with an electron microscope. They are even smaller than their counterparts PM<sub>10</sub>, which are particles that are 10 micrometres or less, and are also called **fine particles**.

Since they are so small and light, fine particles tend to stay longer in the air than heavier particles. This increases the chances of humans and animals inhaling them into the bodies. Owing to their minute size, particles smaller than 2.5 micrometers are able to bypass the nose and throat and penetrate deep into the lungs and some may even enter the circulatory system.

Studies have found a close link between exposure to fine particles and premature death from heart and lung disease. Fine particles are also known to trigger or worsen chronic disease such as asthma, heart attack, bronchitis and other respiratory problems.

Source

Indicates the level of particulate matter.

The ```sensor_particulate``` channel is of type ```sensor_particulate``` and supports the ```Number``` item. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Sensor (relative humidity)
Indicates the current relative humidity.

The ```sensor_relhumidity``` channel is of type ```sensor_relhumidity``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Humidity``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Sensor (temperature)
Indicates the current temperature.

The ```sensor_temperature``` channel is of type ```sensor_temperature``` and supports the ```Number:Temperature``` item and is in the ```Temperature``` category.



## Device Configuration

The device has no configuration parameters defined.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The device does not support associations.
