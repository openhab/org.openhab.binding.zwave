The MH4959 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

## Overview

Battery powered water boiler thermostat MH4959 is a smart boiler thermostat, it can automatically detect the indoor temperature and display the relevant temperature value for boiler heating control. It also can automatically turn on/off the heating system according to the temperature difference.

### Inclusion Information

In normal working interface, long press S4(+) and S5(-) simultaneously for 3 seconds to enter the interface for inclusion or exclusion of Z-Wave network. Before the device included into network, "\---" will display on the screen, short press S4(+) and the device will enter learning mode to get a node ID. If inclusion is success, a node ID will display on the screen in a few seconds, and then short press S1 to exit.

A node ID can always inform us whether the device is in the network or not.

### Exclusion Information

In normal working interface, long press S4(+) and S5(-) simultaneously for 3 seconds to enter the interface for inclusion or exclusion of Z-Wave network.

### Parameter 255: Restore Factory Setting (Secret Menu E01)

Restore Factory Setting
This is an advanced parameter and will therefore not show in the user interface without entering advanced mode.
The following option values may be configured, in addition to values in the range 0 to 0 -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | No action |
| 85 | Factory reset |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (No action).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_255_1_wo``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.
This is a write only parameter.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The MH4959 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 1 node.
