The MH-C221 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

MCO HOME Micro Shutter for windows roller shutter

The device allows for controlling motors of roller blinds, awnings, venetian blinds, gates and others, which are single phase AC powered. This Roller Shutter allows for precise positioning of a roller blind or  venetian blind lamellas. Precise positioning is available for the motors equipped with mechanic and electronic end switches.

The module may be controlled wirelessly, through the Z-Wave network main controller, or through the switch keys connected to it. It’s also possible to combine few devices into groups of devices, which then can be controlled simultaneously. In addition, this Roller Shutter is equipped with Power Metering.

### Inclusion Information

  1. Connect the power supply.
  2. Set the main controller into the learn mode (see main controllers operating manual).
  3. Triple click the B-button or a push button connected to the S1 terminal.
  4. MCO Home Roller Shutter will be detected and included into the Z-Wave network

### Exclusion Information

  1. Make sure the module is connected to the power supply.
  2. Set the main controller into the learn mode (see main controllers operating manual).
  3. Triple click the B-button or a push button connected to the S1 terminal.
