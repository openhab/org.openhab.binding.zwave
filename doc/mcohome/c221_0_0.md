## Overview

MCO HOME Micro Shutter for windows roller shutter

The device allows for controlling motors of roller blinds, awnings, venetian blinds, gates and others, which are single phase AC powered. This Roller Shutter allows for precise positioning of a roller blind or  venetian blind lamellas. Precise positioning is available for the motors equipped with mechanic and electronic end switches.

The module may be controlled wirelessly, through the Z-Wave network main controller, or through the switch keys connected to it. It’s also possible to combine few devices into groups of devices, which then can be controlled simultaneously. In addition, this Roller Shutter is equipped with Power Metering.
