## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The GE 14294 (ZW3005) supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Multilevel Switch Report

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Basic Group

Support Basic Set and is controlled with the local load

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Scene Group

This group gets notifications of double taps via basic set

Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.
