## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The GE 28175 (ZW3106) supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Group 1

Lifeline, Switch Multilevel Report

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Group 2

Basic Set, controlled with the local load

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Group 3

Basic Set, controlled by double pressing the On or Off button

Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.
