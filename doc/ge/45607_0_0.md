## Overview

Transform any home into a smart home with the Jasco Z-Wave Wireless Lighting Control Dimmer Switch. The Jasco Z-Wave Wireless Lighting Control Dimmer Switch enables wireless control of on/off and dim functions of hard-wired incandescent lighting. The dimmer switch replaces your current light switch, uses your existing wiring, and provides Z-Wave wireless and in-wall control of overhead lighting. Use the dimmer feature to customize the lighting output and create the perfect ambiance for any room. Providing ultimate flexibility, the Jasco Z-Wave Wireless Lighting Control Dimmer Switch allows you to operate the switch by itself or easily integrate the switch with two-way, three-way or four-way wiring configurations by adding the Jasco Auxiliary switch for Z-Wave. Two-way wiring configuration turns the light or appliance on/off from one location. Three-way wiring configuration turns the light or appliance on/off from two separate locations. Four-way wiring configuration turns the light or appliance on/off from three separate locations. The Jasco Auxiliary Switch for Z-Wave is required for three-way or four-way installations. The dimmer switch includes an LED indicator light to easily locate the switch in a dark room. Take control of your home lighting with Jasco Z-Wave Wireless Lighting Controls!
