The GE/Jasco 14299 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

**Basic operation** 

The connected light can be turned ON/OFF and adjust dim levels in two ways:

  1. Manually from the front panel of the In-Wall Dimmer.
  2. Remotely with a Z-Wave Controller .

**Manual control** 

The Front Panel Rocker Dimmer allows the user to turn ON/OFF the connected fixture.

  1. To turn the connected fixture ON: press and release the top of the rocker.
  2. To turn the connected fixture OFF: press and release the bottom of the rocker.

**Adjust dim level** 

  1. To increase brightness: press and hold the top of the rocker.
  2. To decrease brightness: press and hold the bottom of the rocker.

**Disable / Enable LED** 

  1. Press UP three (3) times then quickly press and release DOWN one (1) time.
  2. Repeat to disable/enable LED.

**This device supports Association Command Class (3 Groups)**

  1. Association Group 1 supports Lifeline, Switch Multilevel Report
  2. Association Group 2 supports Basic Set and is controlled by pressing the On or Off button with the local load
  3. Association Group 3 supports Basic Set and is controlled by double pressing the On or Off button
  4. Each Association Group supports 5 total nodes

### Inclusion Information

**Adding your device to a Z-Wave network** 

  1. Follow the instructions for your Z-Wave certified controller to add a device to the Z-Wave network.
  2. Once the controller is ready to add your device, press and release the top or bottom of the wireless smart switch (rocker) to add it in the network.

Please reference the controller's manual for instructions.

### Exclusion Information

**To remove and reset the device** 

  1. Follow the instructions for your Z-Wave certified controller to remove a device from the Z-Wave network.
  2. Once the controller is ready to remove your device, press and release the top or bottom of the wireless smart dimmer (rocker) to remove it from the network.

**To return your switch to factory defaults:** 

Quickly press ON (Top) button three (3) times then immediately press the OFF (Bottom) button three (3) times. The LED will flash ON/OFF 5 times when completed successfully. Note: This should only be used in the event your networkâ€™s primary controller is missing or otherwise inoperable.

### Wakeup Information

The GE/Jasco 14299 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The GE/Jasco 14299 supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: controlled with the local load

controlled with the local load
Support Basic Set and is controlled with the local load

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: controlled by double pressing the On or Off button
