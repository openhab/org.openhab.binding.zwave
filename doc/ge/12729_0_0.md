# 12729 In-Wall Smart Dimmer
This describes the Z-Wave device *12729*, manufactured by *Jasco Products* with the thing type UID of ```ge_12729_00_000```.

# Overview

## Inclusion Information
1\. Follow the instructions for your Z-wave certified controller to include a device to the Z-wave network.

2\. Once the controller is ready to include your device, press up and release the toggle switch to include it in the network.

Note: Your controller may need to be within 10 feet of the device to be included.

3\. Once your controller has confirmed that the device has been included, refresh the Z-wave network to optimize performance.

## Channels
The following table summarises the channels available for the 12729

| Channel | Channel Id | Category | Item Type |
|---------|------------|----------|-----------|
| Dimmer | switch_dimmer | DimmableLight | Dimmer | 

### Dimmer
The ```switch_dimmer``` channel supports the ```Dimmer``` item and is in the ```DimmableLight``` category.



## Device Configuration
The following table provides a summary of the 7 configuration parameters available in the 12729.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 4 | Invert Switch | Invert the ON/OFF Switch State. |
| 7 | On/Off Command Dim Step | Indicates how many levels the dimmer will change for each dimming step. |
| 8 | On/Off Command Dim Rate | This sets how often the dim level will change. |
| 9 | Local Control Dim Step | Indicates how many levels the dimmer will change for each dimming step. |
| 10 | Local Control Dim Rate | This sets how often the dim level will change. |
| 11 | ALL ON/ALL OFF Dim Step | Indicates how many levels the dimmer will change for each dimming step. |
| 12 | ALL ON/ALL OFF Dim Rate | This sets how often the dim level will change. |

### Parameter 4: Invert Switch
Invert the ON/OFF Switch State.
If the switch is accidentally installed upside down with “On” at the bottom and “Off” at the top, the default On/Off rocker settings can be reversed by changing parameter 4’s value to “1”.
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | No |
| 1 | Yes |

The manufacturer defined default value is 0 (No).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_4_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 7: On/Off Command Dim Step
Indicates how many levels the dimmer will change for each dimming step.

Values in the range 1 to 99 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is 1.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_7_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 8: On/Off Command Dim Rate
This sets how often the dim level will change.
The timing of the steps can be adjusted in 10 millisecond intervals. As an example, the default setting for parameter 8 is “3”. This means that the lighting level will change every 30 milliseconds when the Dim Command is received. A value of 255 would mean that the level would change every 2.55 seconds. Combined, the two parameters allow dim rate adjustments from 10 milliseconds to 4.2 minutes to go from maximum-to-minimum or minimum-to-maximum brightness levels.
Values in the range 1 to 255 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is 3.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_8_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 9: Local Control Dim Step
Indicates how many levels the dimmer will change for each dimming step.

Values in the range 1 to 99 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is 1.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_9_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 10: Local Control Dim Rate
This sets how often the dim level will change.
The timing of the steps can be adjusted in 10 millisecond intervals. As an example, the default setting for parameter 8 is “3”. This means that the lighting level will change every 30 milliseconds when the Dim Command is received. A value of 255 would mean that the level would change every 2.55 seconds. Combined, the two parameters allow dim rate adjustments from 10 milliseconds to 4.2 minutes to go from maximum-to-minimum or minimum-to-maximum brightness levels.
Values in the range 1 to 255 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is 3.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_10_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 11: ALL ON/ALL OFF Dim Step
Indicates how many levels the dimmer will change for each dimming step.

Values in the range 1 to 99 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is 1.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_11_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 12: ALL ON/ALL OFF Dim Rate
This sets how often the dim level will change.
The timing of the steps can be adjusted in 10 millisecond intervals. As an example, the default setting for parameter 8 is “3”. This means that the lighting level will change every 30 milliseconds when the Dim Command is received. A value of 255 would mean that the level would change every 2.55 seconds. Combined, the two parameters allow dim rate adjustments from 10 milliseconds to 4.2 minutes to go from maximum-to-minimum or minimum-to-maximum brightness levels.
Values in the range 1 to 255 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is 3.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_12_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups
Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The 12729 supports 0 association group.
