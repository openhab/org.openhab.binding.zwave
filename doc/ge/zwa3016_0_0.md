## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The 59350/ZWA3016 supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Lifeline, Binary Switch Report
Association Group 1 supports Lifeline, Binary Switch Report

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Single Press

Single Press
 Association Group 2 supports Basic Set and is controlled by pressing the ON/OFF button with the local load
