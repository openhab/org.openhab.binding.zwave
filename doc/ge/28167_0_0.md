The GE 28167 (ZW3104) does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

Transform any home into a smart home with the GE Z-Wave Plug-In Smart Dimmer. The Smart Dimmer enables wireless control of on/off and dim functions for standard incandescent table and floor lamps, as well as dimmable fluorescent, LED and CFL fixtures and more! Use the dimmer control to customize the lighting output and create the perfect ambiance for any room. The space-saving horizontal module plugs into a standard wall receptacle without blocking the second outlet or obstructing placement of furniture. The Dimmer provides one Z-Wave enabled outlet for the lamp you would like to control. Take control of your home lighting with GE Z-Wave Smart Lighting Controls!

### Inclusion Information

Once the controller is ready to add your smart dimmer, single press and release the manual/program button on the smart dimmer to add it in the network.

### Exclusion Information

Once the controller is ready to remove your device, press and release the manual/program button on the smart dimmer to remove it from the network

### Wakeup Information

The GE 28167 (ZW3104) does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The GE 28167 (ZW3104) supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Association Group 2 

supports Basic Set and is controlled with the local load

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Association Group 3

supports Basic Set and is controlled by double pressing the button

Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.
