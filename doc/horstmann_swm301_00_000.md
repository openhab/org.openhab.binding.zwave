# SWM301 Z-Wave Module for Water Meter

This describes the Z-Wave device *SWM301*, manufactured by *Horstmann Controls Limited* with the thing type UID of ```horstmann_swm301_00_000```. 

Z-Wave Module for Water Meter  


## Overview 

SWM 301 is a battery-powered RF module using Z-WaveÂ® technology for reporting secondary water metering readings in domestic dwellings.

The RF module records the meter reading by backlash-free pick-up on the litre wheel of the meter register and transmits the data over the Zwave network either on a time or delta change.

  


### Inclusion Information 

1.  Put network controller in Inclusion / Exclusion mode.
2.  Hold a small magnet near to reed switch until the LED is turned on. Remove magnet right away when LED turned on. LED will remain on for next 4 seconds and then it will flash once to indicate NIF is sent.
3.  Repeat the step 2 if LED is not flashed once.
4.  The controller will indicate the successful inclusion/ exclusion operation.

  


### Wakeup Information 

Hold a small magnet near to reed switch until the LED is turned on. Remove magnet right away when LED turned on. LED will remain on for next 4 seconds and then it will flash once to indicate NIF is sent.

SWM301 will wake up for 10 seconds after sending NIF
