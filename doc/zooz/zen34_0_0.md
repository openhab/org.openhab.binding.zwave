The ZEN34 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The ZEN34 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

* Control other Z-Wave devices and enable scenes with a click of a button

* Classic paddle switch look and size + magnetic base

* Install in your electrical switch box or mount anywhere on a wall with just adhesive tape

* The latest 700 chip with S2 and SmartStart support

* Powered by batteries, no wires needed

### Inclusion Information

Put the openHAB Z-Wave binding into inclusion mode and click the upper paddle 6 times quickly. The LED indicator will blink blue during the process and light up green once added successfully. It will light up red if failed.

### Exclusion Information

Put the openHAB Z-Wave binding into exclusion mode and click the lower paddle 6 times quickly.

### Wakeup Information

The ZEN34 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


Click the upper paddle 7 times quickly. The LED indicator will stay siolid blue during wakeup and will turn off when the device turns the Z-Wave radio off again.

### General Usage Information

The LED indication will light up any time a paddle is pressed. It will blink once for each tap. You can adjust the LED indicator color and operation mode in the configuration parameters.  


Upper Paddle

**TAP x 1** for Scene 1, pressed (or ON basic for associations)

**TAP x 2, 3, 4, or 5** for Scene 1 multi-tap

**HOLD** for Scene 1, held (or multilevel start level change, add brightness)  


**RELEASE** for Scene 1, released (or multilevel stop level change)

Lower Paddle

**TAP** x 1 for Scene 2, pressed (or OFF basic for associations)

**TAP** x 2, 3, 4, or 5 for Scene 2 multi-tap

**HOLD** for Scene 2, held (or multilevel start level change, dim the light)

**RELEASE** for Scene 2, released (or multilevel stop level change)

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the ZEN34 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Dimmer | switch_dimmer | switch_dimmer | DimmableLight | Dimmer | 
| Scene Number | scene_number | scene_number |  | Number | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | system.battery_level | Battery | Number |

### Dimmer
The brightness channel allows to control the brightness of a light.
            It is also possible to switch the light on and off.

The ```switch_dimmer``` channel is of type ```switch_dimmer``` and supports the ```Dimmer``` item and is in the ```DimmableLight``` category.

### Scene Number
Triggers when a scene button is pressed.

The ```scene_number``` channel is of type ```scene_number``` and supports the ```Number``` item.
This channel provides the scene, and the event as a decimal value in the form ```<scene>.<event>```. The scene number is set by the device, and the event is as follows -:

| Event ID | Event Description  |
|----------|--------------------|
| 0        | Single key press   |
| 1        | Key released       |
| 2        | Key held down      |
| 3        | Double keypress    |
| 4        | Tripple keypress   |
| 5        | 4 x keypress       |
| 6        | 5 x keypress       |

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.


## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 3 configuration parameters available in the ZEN34.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | LED indication mode |  |
| 2 | Upper paddle indicator color |  |
| 3 | Lower paddle indicator color |  |
|  | Wakeup Interval | Sets the interval at which the device will accept commands from the controller |
|  | Wakeup Node | Sets the node ID of the device to receive the wakeup notifications |

### Parameter 1: LED indication mode



The following option values may be configured, in addition to values in the range 0 to 2 -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | LED always OFF |
| 1 | LED ON when button pressed |
| 2 | LED always ON (color from #2) |
| 3 | LED always ON (color from #3) |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (LED ON when button pressed).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Upper paddle indicator color



The following option values may be configured, in addition to values in the range 0 to 6 -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | White |
| 1 | Blue |
| 2 | Green |
| 3 | Red |
| 4 | Magenta |
| 5 | Yellow |
| 6 | Cyan |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (Blue).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: Lower paddle indicator color



The following option values may be configured, in addition to values in the range 0 to 6 -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | White |
| 1 | Blue |
| 2 | Green |
| 3 | Red |
| 4 | Magenta |
| 5 | Yellow |
| 6 | Cyan |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (White).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZEN34 supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Basic Set


Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Switch Multilevel


Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.
