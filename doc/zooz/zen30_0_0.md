You can assign scenes to 1-tap, 2-tap, 3-tap, 4-tap, 5-tap, or press-and-hold for any of the paddles and the relay button. Your hub needs to support central scene implementation for this feature to be available.</p&gt

### Inclusion Information

<ol&gt<li&gtEnable Inclusion for the Z-Wave binding</li&gt <li&gtQuickly tap the upper paddle on the dimmer 3 times</li&gt <li&gtThe LED indicators will blink to signal communication and remain on for 2 seconds to confirm inclusion</li&gt </ol&gt

### Exclusion Information

<ol&gt<li&gtEnable Exclusion for the Z-Wave binding</li&gt <li&gtBring your Z-Wave gateway (hub) close to the switch, if possible</li&gt <li&gtQuickly tap the lower paddle on the dimmer 3 times</li&gt </ol&gt

### General Usage Information

<p&gtTroubleshooting</p&gt <ol&gt<li&gtIf the switch won’t add to your system, initiate EXCLUSION and tap the lower paddle 3 times quickly</li&gt <li&gtTap the upper paddle 4-5 times quickly when adding it</li&gt <li&gtBring the gateway controller (hub) closer to the switch, it may be out of range</li&gt </ol&gt<p&gtFactory Reset</p&gt <p&gtIf your primary controller is missing or inoperable, you may need to reset the device to factory settings. To complete the reset process manually, press and hold the lower paddle on the dimmer for at least 15 seconds until the LED indicators start flashing, then release. Then immediately press and hold the upper paddle on the dimmer for at least 15 seconds. The LED indicators will flash again to confirm successful reset.</p&gt <p&gtNOTE: All previously recorded activity and custom settings will be erased from the device’s memory.</p&gt

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZEN30 supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: BASIC_SET (dimmer)

<p&gtThe dimmer supports Group 2 with up to 5 devices and will send BASIC_SET report to other devices in Group 2 to communicate status changes.</p&gt

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: BASIC_SET (relay)

<p&gtThe relay supports Group 3 with up to 5 devices BASIC_SET report to other devices in Group 3 if its status changes.</p&gt

Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.
