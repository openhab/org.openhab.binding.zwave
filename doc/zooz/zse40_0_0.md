## Device Configuration
The following table provides a summary of the 7 configuration parameters available in the ZSE40.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Temperature Scale | Set the temperature scale |
| 2 | Temperature offset | temperature change to be reported |
| 3 | Humidity | Configure Relative Humidity |
| 4 | Light Sensor | Configure Light Sensor |
| 5 | Trigger Interval | Set the trigger interval for motion sensor re-activation. |
| 6 | Motion Sensor Sensitivity | Adjust sensitivity of the motion sensor. |
| 7 | LED indicator mode | Select the LED indicator mode |

### Parameter 1: Temperature Scale
Set the temperature scale

The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Celsius |
| 1 | Fahrenheit |

The manufacturer defined default value is 0 (Celsius).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Temperature offset
temperature change to be reported
Use it to set temperature change to be reported by the sensor. Values: 1 - 50 (where 1 stands for 0.1 degree and 50 stands for 5 degrees). Default set to 1 degree (value 10). The sensor will report new temperature value to the controller whenever temperature goes 1 degree up or down.
Values in the range 0 to 50 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is 1.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: Humidity
Configure Relative Humidity
Use it to set humidity percentage change to be reported by the sensor. Values: 1 - 50 where 1 stands for 1% and 50 stands for 50%. Default set to 10%.
Values in the range 1 to 50 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is 10.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 4: Light Sensor
Configure Light Sensor
Reports light level in percentage (1-100). Use it to choose light percentage change to be reported by the sensor. Values: 5 - 50 where 5 stands for 5% and 50 stands for 50%. Default set to 10%.
Values in the range 1 to 50 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is 10.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_4_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 5: Trigger Interval
Set the trigger interval for motion sensor re-activation.
Use it to set trigger interval - the time when motion is reported again after initial trigger. Values: 1 - 255 where 1 stands for 1 minute and 255 stands for 255 minutes. Default set to 3 minutes. Size: 1 byte dec. NOTE: Small interval will increase activity and decrease battery life.
Values in the range 1 to 255 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is 3.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_5_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 6: Motion Sensor Sensitivity
Adjust sensitivity of the motion sensor.

The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 1 | highest |
| 2 | higher |
| 3 | high |
| 4 | normal |
| 5 | low |

The manufacturer defined default value is 4 (normal).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_6_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 7: LED indicator mode
Select the LED indicator mode
LED indicator will flash every 3 minutes or whenever you press the Z-Wave button to indicate temperature level.

Green = under 60°F

Blue = 60°-75°F

Yellow = 75°-83°F

Purple = 83°-97°F

Red = over 97°F / motion detected / tamper switch triggered
The following option values may be configured -:

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_7_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups
Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZSE40 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Receive updates
Receive sensor updates
This group supports 5 nodes.
