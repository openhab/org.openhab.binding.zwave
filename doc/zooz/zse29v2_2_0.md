The ZSE29 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The ZSE29 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

OUTDOOR SENSOR: Introducing the first Z-Wave motion detector created for outdoor use. Monitor activity remotely through your Z-Wave hub and automate outdoor lighting based on motion. Battery or 5V USB powered.

### Inclusion Information

Click the tamper switch 3 times quickly

### Exclusion Information

  1. Bring the sensor within direct range of your Z-Wave gateway (hub).
  2. Put the Z-Wave hub into exclusion mode.
  3. Press and release the tamper switch 3 times quickly.
  4. Your hub will confirm exclusion and the sensor will disappear from your controller's device list.

### Wakeup Information

The ZSE29 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


To manually wake up the device, press and release the tamper switch 3 times quickly. (The manual says one press but appears to be incorrect.)

The sensor’s wake-up interval is set to 4 hours by default to save battery life. Use the Wake Up Command Class to adjust the interval (in seconds, working in 600s intervals, with 600 as min and 86400 as max values). During wake-up, the sensor turns the Z-Wave radio on for 10 seconds to receive communication from the hub. Long wake-up interval will not affect how often the sensor reports motion to your hub.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the ZSE29 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |

Indicates if the burglar alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_burglar``` channel is of type ```alarm_burglar``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Door``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |

### Alarm (power)
Indicates if a power alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_power``` channel is of type ```alarm_power``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.

0 - set manually by lux knob (default)

1 - ignore lux readings and always report motion

10-900 - set custom trigger
The following option values may be configured, in addition to values in the range 10 to 900 -:

| Value  | Description |

| 1 | Ignore lux readings and always report motion |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Set manually by lux knob).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_4_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 5: Motion re-trigger time

Motion re-trigger time
Set motion re-trigger time for the delay before the sensor reports no motion to the hub and associated devices after detecting the last motion activity.

0 - set manually by timer knob (default)

5-720 (seconds) - set custom re-trigger time

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Set manually by timer knob |

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_5_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 6: Lux reporting frequency

Lux reporting frequency
Set lux reporting frequency to decide how often in minutes the sensor will measure and send brightness level data to the hub and associated devices. The default is 30 minutes and the range is 1-1440. Note: Frequent reports will affect battery life.
Values in the range 1 to 1440 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```30```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_6_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 7: Reading from physical motion clear knob

Reading from physical motion clear knob
**READ ONLY.** Read the values for the timer (motion clear) knob set physically at the sensor.

**Values: **5 (at T position / test mode); 30; 60; 300; 600; 720 (seconds).
Values in the range 5 to 720 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```5```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_7_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.
This is a read only parameter.


### Parameter 8: Reading from physical low lux trigger knob

Reading from physical low lux trigger knob
**READ ONLY. **Read the values for the lux trigger knob set physically at the sensor.

**Values: **10; 50; 100; 200; 300; 900 lux (at T position / test mode).
Values in the range 10 to 900 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```900```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_8_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.
This is a read only parameter.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZSE29 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Notification Reports to Controller

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Group 2

Basic Set commands PIR Control
The Outdoor Motion Sensor supports Group 1 with 1 Controller node for lifeline communication and Group 2 with up to 4 devices for PIR Control. This device will send a Notification Report to Group 1 and BASIC_SET command to Group 2 whenever it detects motion.

Association group 2 supports 4 nodes.
