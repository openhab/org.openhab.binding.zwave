The ZSE42 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The ZSE42 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

### Inclusion Information

**1. ADD DEVICE to your hub**

  * Initiate inclusion (pairing) in the app (or web interface).  
    
  * If you’re using an S2 hub, it will ask you to enter the DSK PIN or scan the QR code printed on the back cover sticker of the sensor to complete SmartStart inclusion.

**2. ACTIVATE the sensor**

  * While the hub is looking for new devices, click the Z-Wave button 3 times as quickly as possible. The LED indicator will start flashing to confirm inclusion mode and turn off once inclusion is completed. 

**TIP!**

It’s best to add your sensor from the area where it will be installed so the hub can find the best route to reach it right away

### Exclusion Information

  1. Bring the sensor within direct range of your Z-Wave hub.
  2. Put the Z-Wave hub into exclusion mode
  3. Click the Z-Wave button 3 times as quickly as possible.

Your hub will confirm exclusion and the sensor will disappear from your controller's device list.

### Wakeup Information

The ZSE42 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


**Wakeup**  


The sensor’s wake-up interval is set to 12 hours by default to save battery life. Use the Wake Up Command Class to adjust the interval. Click the Z-Wave button 4 times quickly to wake the sensor up manually. The LED indicator will flash twice to confirm the device is awake. During wake-up, the sensor turns the Z-Wave radio on for one minute to receive communication from the hub. Long wake-up interval will not affect how often the sensor reports to your hub so we recommend leaving the default to conserve battery life.

### General Usage Information

**Factory Reset**  


When your network’s primary controller is missing or otherwise inoperable, you may need to reset the device to factory settings manually.  In order to complete the process, make sure the sensor is powered, then click the Z-Wave button twice and hold it the third time for 10 seconds. The LED indicator will blink continuously.  Immediately after, click the Z-Wave button twice more to finalize the reset.  The LED indicator will flash 3 times to confirm a successful reset.

The ```sensor_binary``` channel is of type ```sensor_binary``` and supports the ```Switch``` item. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| ON | Triggered |
| OFF | Untriggered |

### Alarm (flood)
Indicates if the flood alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_flood``` channel is of type ```alarm_flood``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Water``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.

|  | Wakeup Node | Sets the node ID of the device to receive the wakeup notifications |

### Parameter 1: LED Indicator

Turn the LED indicator on (blinking) or off when a water leak is detected.

The following option values may be configured, in addition to values in the range 0 to 0 -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | LED indicator won't blink when the sensor detects water |
| 1 | LED indicator will blink continuously when water is detected (default) |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (LED indicator will blink continuously when water is detected (default)).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Leak Alert Clear Delay

Decide how long the sensor should wait before sending a "dry" report to your hub after water is no longer detected
**Values:** 0-3600 (seconds)

**Default:** 0 seconds (no delay)  


0 - reports “dry” to the hub immediately a leak is no longer detected
Values in the range 0 to 3600 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: Battery Reporting Threshold

Set the threshold for battery reporting
**Values:** 1-50%

**Default:** 10%
Values in the range 1 to 50 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```10```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 4: Low Battery Reporting Level

Decide when the sensor should report low battery to the hub.
**Values:** 10-50 (% battery life)

**Default:** 20%
Values in the range 10 to 50 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```20```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_4_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 5: Basic Set Commands

Decide if and when the sensor sends Basic Set commands are sent to the hub and Group 2

The following option values may be configured, in addition to values in the range 0 to 0 -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Basic Set commands not sent at all |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (Basic Set 255/0 for ON/OFF when water detected/not detected (default)).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_5_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZSE42 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Group 2

Send BASIC_SET reports whenever water is detected

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.
