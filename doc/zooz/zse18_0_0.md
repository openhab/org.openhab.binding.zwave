The ZSE18 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The ZSE18 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

Motion detection, built-in vibration sensor, S2 security protocol and AES-128 signal encryption, 2 alternative power sources: 1 CR123A battery or micro USB, auto-inclusion for instant set-up, visual range test tool, magnetic mount, adjustable LED indicator, low battery alerts, Z-Wave Plus 

### Inclusion Information

  * For USB power, in stay awake mode, press and hold the button. **NOTE**: The device will continue in stay awake mode even if later moved to battery power.
  * Press and release the Z-Wave button 3 times quickly for battery mode. 

### Exclusion Information

Press and release the Z-Wave button on the sensor 3 times as quickly as possible.

### Wakeup Information

The ZSE18 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


Press and release the Z-Wave button on the sensor 3 times as quickly as possible.

### General Usage Information

# Range Test Tool

You can easily check if the sensor is within your Z-Wave hub’s range:

Press and **hold** the Z-Wave button for 10-15 seconds and release it to start the test. The LED indicator will then report signal strength.

  * Solid blue = direct communication with the primary controller is stable
  * Slow blinking blue = communication quality is fair
  * Fast blinking blue = communication with the primary controller has failed

Press and release the Z-Wave button to exit testing mode.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the ZSE18 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Binary Sensor | sensor_binary | sensor_binary |  | Switch | 
| Alarm (burglar) | alarm_burglar | alarm_burglar | Door | Switch | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | system.battery_level | Battery | Number |

### Binary Sensor
Indicates if a sensor has triggered.

The ```sensor_binary``` channel is of type ```sensor_binary``` and supports the ```Switch``` item. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| ON | Triggered |
| OFF | Untriggered |

### Alarm (burglar)
Indicates if the burglar alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_burglar``` channel is of type ```alarm_burglar``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Door``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.

| 14 | BASIC SET reports | 0 - disabled, 1 - enabled |
| 15 | reverse BASIC SET | 0: 255 motion, 0 timeout. 1: 0 motion, 255 timeout |
| 17 | vibration sensor | 0=disabled, 1=enabled |
| 18 | trigger interval | 3=6 seconds, 65535=65538 seconds (add 3 seconds to value set) |
| 20 | LED Indicator | 0=disabled, 1=enabled (default) |
| 32 | Low Battery Alert | percent battery left |
|  | Wakeup Interval | Sets the interval at which the device will accept commands from the controller |
|  | Wakeup Node | Sets the node ID of the device to receive the wakeup notifications |

### Parameter 12:  PIR sensor sensitivity

1 = low sensitivity and 8 = high sensitivity.

Values in the range 1 to 8 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```4```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_12_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 14: BASIC SET reports

0 - disabled, 1 - enabled
to enable or disable BASIC SET reports when motion is triggered for Group 2 of associated devices. 
Values in the range 0 to 1 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_14_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 15: reverse BASIC SET

0: 255 motion, 0 timeout. 1: 0 motion, 255 timeout
 Use it to reverse values sent in BASIC SET reports when motion is triggered for Group 2 of associated devices. 

0 - BASIC SET sends 255 when motion is triggered, BASIC SET sends 0 when motion times out 

1 - BASIC SET sends 0 when motion is triggered, BASIC SET sends 255 when motion times out. 
Values in the range 0 to 1 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_15_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 17: vibration sensor

0=disabled, 1=enabled
 disable the vibration sensor
Values in the range 0 to 1 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_17_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 18: trigger interval

3=6 seconds, 65535=65538 seconds (add 3 seconds to value set)
set trigger interval - the time when motion is reported again after initial trigger. 

NOTE: Small interval will increase activity and decrease battery life.

battery level for low battery reports
Values in the range 10 to 50 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```10```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_32_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZSE18 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: motion detection and battery level


Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: BASIC SET


Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.
