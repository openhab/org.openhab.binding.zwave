The ZSE41 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The ZSE41 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

  * **Door / window monitoring**: fast and reliable reports sent to your Z-Wave hub whenever a door or window is open or closed 
  * **Extra small**: slim and discreet enough to easily blend in with most frames and surfaces
  * **Protective surface**: coated with rubber oil to prevent corrosion and water leak damage
  * **New 700 series Z-Wave chip**: faster, more secure, and reliable wireless communication with greater range than ever 
  * **Outdoor installation**: use the dedicated waterproof cover case for the ZSE41 (sold separately) to mount it anywhere outside 
  * Power it with a single CR2032 battery 
  * SmartStart for easier and safer pairing 
  * Advanced settings to customize your sensor

### Inclusion Information

  1. Use a small flat screwdriver to gently open the sensor’s cover and access the battery. Pull the tab from under the battery to activate the sensor. Don’t close the cover just yet. The LED indicator will start blinking for around 10 seconds once the sensor is powered. 
  2. Bring the sensor to the location where you plan to mount it at.
  3. Put your Z-Wave gateway controller into inclusion/pairing mode.
  4. Scan the QR code or enter the PIN code located on the back of the battery cover if your hub supports SmartStart S2 inclusion.
  5. Click the Z-Wave button on the sensor 3 TIMES QUICKLY. The LED indicator will flash quickly.
  6. A new open/close (door/window) sensor will appear on your controller’s device list.

### Exclusion Information

  1. Bring the sensor within **direct range** of your Z-Wave hub.
  2. Put the Z-Wave hub into **exclusion** mode (not sure how to do that? ask@getzooz.com).
  3. Click the **Z-Wave button 3 times** as quickly as possible.
  4. Your hub will confirm exclusion and the sensor will disappear from your controller's device list.

### Wakeup Information

The ZSE41 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


The sensor’s wake-up interval is set to 12 hours by default to save battery life. Use the Wake Up Command Class to adjust the interval. **Click the Z-Wave button 4 times quickly to wake the sensor up manually**. The LED indicator will flash twice to confirm the device is awake. During wake-up, the sensor turns the Z-Wave radio on for one minute to receive communication from the hub. Long wake-up interval will not affect how often the sensor reports to your hub so we recommend leaving the default setting to conserve battery.

### General Usage Information

When your network’s primary controller is missing or otherwise inoperable, you may need to reset the device to factory settings manually. In order to complete the process, make sure the sensor is powered, then **click the Z-Wave button twice and hold it the third time for 10 seconds**. The LED indicator will blink  continuously. **Immediately after, click the Z-Wave button twice more to finalize  the reset**. The LED indicator will flash 3 times to confirm a successful reset.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZSE41 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Group 1

Lifeline


Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Basic Set

Send Basic Set command to group 2
This device will send a **Basic Set** command to Group 2 whenever it detects a change in the open/close status. It sends an ON command when OPEN status is detected and OFF command when CLOSED status is detected.

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.
