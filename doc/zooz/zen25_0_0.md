# ZEN25 Double Plug
This describes the Z-Wave device *ZEN25*, manufactured by *[Zooz](http://www.getzooz.com/)* with the thing type UID of ```zooz_zen25_00_000```.
This version of the device is limited to firmware versions below 1.255

The device is in the category of *Power Outlet*, defining Small devices to be plugged into a power socket in a wall which stick there.

The ZEN25 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

The Double Plug works great as a low profile on/off device for a couple of lamps or small appliances (10A total between both outlets). But it can serve as a smart power monitor, a signal tester, or extender as well. It's fast, it's secure, and it's small.

As always, we've included a bunch of useful settings for you to customize the plug so you get the most of it. There is a built-in timer for remote reboots of connected devices or the option to turn off manual control. But if you find anything missing, just let us know and we'll add it

### Inclusion Information

AUTO INCLUSION

  1. Initiate inclusion (pairing) in the app (or web interface). Not sure how? ask@getzooz.com
  2. Plug the device into a grounded 120 VAC receptacle you’re planning to use it at (it doesn’t need to be close. Put your Z-Wave hub into inclusion mode and click the Z-Wave button 3 times quickly. The LED indicators will start blinking and the Double Plug will join the network automatically. If it lights up in yellow, inclusion has failed.
  3. You will see 4 new on/off devices in your app: 2 channels for on/off control, 1 channel for on/off monitoring (the USB port reporting charging/ charged status, no control), and 1 master node to control both outlets at the same time and to access and adjust advanced settings in (if your hub supports parameter input).

MANUAL INCLUSION

Put your Z-Wave hub into inclusion mode and click the Z-Wave button 3 times quickly.

### Exclusion Information

  1. Bring the plug within direct range of your Z-Wave gateway (hub).
  2. Put the Z-Wave hub into exclusion mode (not sure how to do that? ask@getzooz.com).
  3. Press and release the Z-Wave button 3 times quickly.
  4. Your hub will confirm exclusion and all of the channels (child outlets) and the main device will disappear from your controller's device list.

### General Usage Information

# Range Test Tool

You can easily check if the Double Plug is within your Z-Wave hub’s range:

Press and hold the Z-Wave button for 6 to 8 seconds until the LED indicator turns violet. The LED indicator will then report signal strength.

  * **Solid green** = direct communication with the primary controller is stable
  * **Flashing green** = direct communication with the primary controller is established but signal is weak
  * **Solid orange** = stable communication with hub via repeaters
  * **Flashing orange** = communication with the primary controller is established via repeaters but signal is weak
  * **Solid red** = communication with the primary controller has failed

Press and release the Z-Wave button to exit testing mode.

**NOTE**: This function may only be activated once the Double Plug has been included to a Z-Wave network.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZEN25 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Basic set notifications


Association group 2 supports 1 node.
