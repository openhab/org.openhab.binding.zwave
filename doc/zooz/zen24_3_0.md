The ZEN24 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

  * Manual or remote on/off and dimming control from your mobile device or computer (when included to a Z-Wave gateway controller)
  * Universal 3-way capability â€“ works with existing 3-way switches as long as neutral is present
  * Z-Wave Plus with improved 500 chip for faster and safer wireless communication
  * Works with LED, CFL, and incandescent bulbs
  * Remembers and restores on/off / brightness status after power failure
  * Based on universal multilevel switch command class - supported by most Z-Wave controllers
  * May be associated and grouped with other Z-Wave devices for advanced home automation
  * Air-gap switch for added safety
  * Classic toggle design
  * Built-in Z-Wave signal repeater for a stronger, more reliable network
  * Configurable Ramp-Rate (Two options)

### Inclusion Information

  1. Bring your Z-Wave gateway hub or controller as close to the switch as possible
  2. Put your Z-Wave controller into inclusion mode
  3. Toggle the switch UP 3 times very quickly to finalize the inclusion process
  4. A new dimming device will appear on your controller's device list

**TROUBLESHOOTING TIPS:**

If you are unable to include the Z-Wave switch to your controller, please try one of the following:

  * Bring the controller closer to your ZWave switch or use a hand-held secondary controller for inclusion
  * Toggle your Z-Wave switch UP even quicker at least 5 or 7 times once you put the controller into inclusion mode to ensure the command has gone through
  * Put your controller into EXCLUSION mode and toggle the switch DOWN 3 times quickly, then try adding it to your network again

### Exclusion Information

  1. Bring your Z-Wave gateway hub or controller as close to the switch as possible
  2. Put your Z-Wave controller into exclusion mode 3. Toggle the switch DOWN
  3. times very quickly to complete the exclusion process
  4. The device will disappear from your controller's device list

Please repeat the process following all steps carefully if the first attempt is unsuccessful.

### Wakeup Information

The ZEN24 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the ZEN24 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Dimmer | switch_dimmer | switch_dimmer | DimmableLight | Dimmer | 

### Dimmer

            It is also possible to switch the light on and off.

The ```switch_dimmer``` channel is of type ```switch_dimmer``` and supports the ```Dimmer``` item and is in the ```DimmableLight``` category.



## Device Configuration

The device has no configuration parameters defined.

## Association Groups
