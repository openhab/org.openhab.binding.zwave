The ZEN26 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

Manual or Z-Wave on/off control with instant status updates

Simple Direct 3-Way: connect with existing on/off switches in 3-way, 4-way, and 5-way set-ups, no add-on needed (neutral wire required)

Remembers and restores on/off status after power failure

LED indicator signals inclusion, exclusion, reset, and setting changes

Built-in Z-Wave Plus signal repeater to extend network range

Works with LED, CFL, and incandescent bulbs

S2 security protocol and the latest 500 Z-Wave chip for faster and safer wireless communication

Supported by most Z-Wave controllers

### Inclusion Information

TAP Upper paddle 3-5 TIMES QUICKLY

The LED indicator will blink to signal communication and remain on for 2 seconds to confirm inclusion

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZEN26 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
This device will send BINARY SWITCH REPORT to Group 1 and 2 when operated manually

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Group 2

This device will send BINARY SWITCH REPORT to Group 1 and 2 when operated manually

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.
