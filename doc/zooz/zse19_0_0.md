  * Audio Speaker for custom sound playback (if Sound Switch is supported)
  * S2 security protocol and the latest 500 Z-Wave chip for faster and safer wireless communication
  * Tamper protection, low-battery alerts
  * Model Number: ZSE19
  * Z-Wave Signal Frequency: 908.42 MHz
  * Power: 4 x LR14 (C Cell) battery
  * Range: Up to 100 feet line of sight
  * Operating Temperature: 14-104° F (-10-40° C)
  * Operating Humidity: 0-80%
  * Installation and Use: Indoor only

### Inclusion Information

AUTO INCLUSION:

  1. Put your controller into inclusion mode
  2. Insert the batteries as instructed (if you already did, take them out for at least 15 seconds before starting the inclusion process). The LED indicator will start blinking and the Multisiren will join the network automatically.

MANUAL INCLUSION:

Put your Z-Wave hub into inclusion mode and click the Z-Wave button on the Multisiren 3 times quickly. 

### Exclusion Information

  1. Bring the Multisiren within direct range of your Z-Wave gateway (hub).
  2. Put the Z-Wave hub into exclusion mode (not sure how to do that? ask@getzooz.com).
  3. Click the Z-Wave button on the Multisiren 3 times quickly to finalize the process.
  4. Your hub will confirm exclusion and the device will disappear from your controller's device list. 

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the ZSE19  -:

| Sensor (relative humidity) | sensor_relhumidity | Humidity | Number | 
| Custom Sound Selection for Audio Speaker  [Deprecated]| config_decimal |  | Number | 
| Alarm (burglar) | alarm_burglar | Door | Switch | 
| Alarm (power) | alarm_power | Door | Switch | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | Battery | Number |

### Switch
Switch the power on and off.

The ```switch_binary``` channel supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Switch``` category.

### Sensor (temperature)
Indicates the current temperature.

The ```sensor_temperature``` channel supports the ```Number:Temperature``` item and is in the ```Temperature``` category.

### Sensor (relative humidity)
Indicates the current relative humidity.

The ```sensor_relhumidity``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Humidity``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Custom Sound Selection for Audio Speaker [Deprecated]
0=pause (no sound, default)

1-99=sound (file) number in the library to be triggered

Generic class for configuration parameter.

The ```config_decimal``` channel supports the ```Number``` item.

**Note:** This channel is marked as deprecated so should not be used.

### Alarm (burglar)
Indicates if the burglar alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_burglar``` channel supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Door``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |

### Alarm (power)
Indicates if a power alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_power``` channel supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Door``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```battery-level``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.



## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 3 configuration parameters available in the ZSE19 .
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Siren Alarm Duration | Set the Siren Alarm Duration |
| 2 | temp & humidity reporting interval | set temp & humidity reporting interval |
| 3 | Custom Sound Selection for Audio Speaker | Set Custom Sound Selection for Audio Speaker |

### Parameter 1: Siren Alarm Duration

Set the Siren Alarm Duration

Values in the range 10 to 600 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```180```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: temp & humidity reporting interval

set temp & humidity reporting interval

Values in the range 1 to 1440 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```30```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: Custom Sound Selection for Audio Speaker

Set Custom Sound Selection for Audio Speaker
0=pause (no sound, default)  
1-99=sound (file) number in the library to be triggered
Values in the range 0 to 99 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZSE19  supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Z-Wave Plus Lifeline

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.
