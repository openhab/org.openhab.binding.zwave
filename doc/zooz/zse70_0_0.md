The ZSE70 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The ZSE70 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

Sensor monitors motion, lux, and temperature. Utilizes Z-Wave Plus LR for signal up to 1300 feet from hub. Equipped with level S2 security. Rated for outdoor use. Powered by either batteries or optional 12-24 V power supply.

### Inclusion Information

Put your Z-Wave hub into _inclusion_ mode and click the Z-Wave button three times quickly. The LED indicator will confirm inclusion mode.

### Exclusion Information

Put your Z-Wave hub into _exclusion_ mode and click the Z-Wave button three times quickly.

### Wakeup Information

The ZSE70 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


The sensor’s wake-up interval is set to 4 hours by default to save battery life. Use the Wake Up Command Class to adjust the interval (in seconds, working in 3600s intervals, with 3600 as min and 86400 as max values).

Click the Z-Wave button once to wake the sensor up manually. During wake-up, the sensor turns the Z-Wave radio for 10 seconds to receive communication from the hub. Long wake-up interval will not affect how often the sensor reports motion or other values to your hub.

### General Usage Information

Outdoor rated single sensor to monitor motion, lux, and temperature. Use to automate lights, sirens, or sprinklers. 

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the ZSE70 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |

| Sensor (luminance) | sensor_luminance | sensor_luminance |  | Number | 
| Alarm (burglar) | alarm_burglar | alarm_burglar | Door | Switch | 
| Alarm (power) | alarm_power | alarm_power | Energy | Switch | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | system.battery_level | Battery | Number |

### Sensor (temperature)
Indicates the current temperature.

The ```sensor_temperature``` channel is of type ```sensor_temperature``` and supports the ```Number:Temperature``` item and is in the ```Temperature``` category.

### Sensor (luminance)
Indicates the current light reading.

The ```sensor_luminance``` channel is of type ```sensor_luminance``` and supports the ```Number``` item. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Alarm (burglar)
Indicates if the burglar alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_burglar``` channel is of type ```alarm_burglar``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Door``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |

### Alarm (power)
Indicates if a power alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_power``` channel is of type ```alarm_power``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_17_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZSE70 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline Communication

This device supports Group 1 with 5 nodes for Lifeline communication.
This device will send a Notification and Sensor Multilevel Report to Group 1.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: On/Off Control

This device supports Group 2 with up to 5 devices for basic on/off control.
This device will send Basic Set command to Group 2 whenever it detects motion.

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.
