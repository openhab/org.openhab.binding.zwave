The ZAC38 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

- Extend your network with this repeater

- Backup battery and power outage notifications

- 800 series chip for faster communication and more range

### Inclusion Information

While the controller is scanning for new devices, click the button 3 times as quickly as possible.  LED indicator will flash green to confirm inclusion mode and turn green for 2 seconds once inclusion is completed.

### Exclusion Information

Initiate Exclusion on the controller and click the button 3 times as quickly as possible.

### General Usage Information

Battery Reporting

Parameter 1: Set the % level of the battery when the device will send a low battery alert to the hub.

Values: 0-50 (%). Default: 10.

Size: 1 byte dec

Parameter 2: Decide whether you would like the battery to be reported according to a % change threshold (set in parameter 3) or whether that should be ignored. 

Values: 

0 – don't report battery according to the reporting threshold;

1 – report battery according to the reporting threshold (default).

Size: 1 byte dec

Parameter 3: Set the reporting threshold for the battery. The device will send new battery reports only if that % threshold is met. 

Values: 5-50 (%). Default: 10.

Size: 1 byte dec

Parameter 4: Decide how often the device should report battery changes once the reporting threshold from parameter 3 is met. The device will send new battery reports once % threshold is met in the intervals set in this setting. 

Values: 1-65535 (seconds). Default: 600.

Size: 3 byte dec

Parameter 5: Decide whether you would like the battery to be auto-reported according to the frequency set in parameter 6. If this setting is enabled, the device will send battery reports in the set interval regardless of the reporting threshold set in parameter 3. 

Values: 

0 – auto-reports disabled;

1 – auto-reports enabled (default).

Size: 1 byte dec

Parameter 6: Set the frequency for auto-reports from the battery. The device will send new battery reports according to the interval set in this setting as long as it's enabled in parameter 5 and regardless of the % threshold set in parameter 3. 

Values: 

0 – auto-reports disabled;

1 – auto-reports enabled (default).

Size: 1 byte dec

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the ZAC38 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Alarm (power) | alarm_power | alarm_power | Energy | Switch | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | system.battery_level | Battery | Number |

### Alarm (power)
Indicates if a power alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_power``` channel is of type ```alarm_power``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.


## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 6 configuration parameters available in the ZAC38.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Battery Reporting | Set the % level of the battery when the device will send a low battery alert to the hub. Values: 0-50 (%). Default: 10. |
| 2 | Battery Reporting | Decide whether you would like the battery to be reported according to a % change threshold (set in parameter 3) or whether that should be ignored. Values: 0 – don't report battery according to the reporting threshold; 1 – report battery |
| 3 | Battery Reporting | Set the reporting threshold for the battery. The device will send new battery reports only if that % threshold is met. Values: 5-50 (%). Default: 10. |
| 4 | Battery Reporting | Decide how often the device should report battery changes once the reporting threshold from parameter 3 is met. The device will send new battery reports once % threshold is met in the intervals set in this setting. |
| 5 | Battery Reporting | Decide whether you would like the battery to be auto-reported according to the frequency set in parameter 6. If this setting is enabled, the device will send battery reports in the set interval regardless of parameter 3 |
| 6 | Battery Reporting | Set the frequency for auto-reports from the battery. The device will send new battery reports according to the interval set in this setting as long as it's enabled in parameter 5 and regardless of the % threshold set in parameter 3. |

### Parameter 1: Battery Reporting

Set the % level of the battery when the device will send a low battery alert to the hub. Values: 0-50 (%). Default: 10.

Values in the range 0 to 50 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```10```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Battery Reporting

Decide whether you would like the battery to be reported according to a % change threshold (set in parameter 3) or whether that should be ignored. Values: 0 – don't report battery according to the reporting threshold; 1 – report battery

Values in the range 0 to 1 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: Battery Reporting

Values in the range 5 to 50 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```10```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 4: Battery Reporting

Values in the range 0 to 1 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_6_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZAC38 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 1 node.
