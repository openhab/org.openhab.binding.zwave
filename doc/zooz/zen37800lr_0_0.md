The ZEN37 800LR supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The ZEN37 800LR does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

  * 4 smart buttons: control Z-Wave devices and activate scenes  
    
  * Install anywhere: fits a standard decora switch box, sticks to a wall, or keeps handy on your night stand  
    
  * No wires: this device is powered by a rechargeable battery for easier installation and low maintenance  
    
  * Scene Control (select hubs only): run up to 24 scenes or control up to 24 devices with multi-tap triggers.  
    
  * NEW 800 chip: more range, faster signal, SmartStart inclusion + S2 security  
    
  * Z-Wave Long Range ready: extend the wireless coverage up to 1300 feet if your hub supports Long Range  
    
  * Magnetic base: take the remote out whenever you need to use it like a traditional remote control and put it back on the base for easy access next time

### Inclusion Information

Put your Z-Wave hub into inclusion mode and click the top button 6 times quickly. The LED indicator will blink blue during the process and light up green once added successfully. It will light up red if failed.  


Or scan the QR code shown on the back side of the remote.

### Exclusion Information

  1. Bring the Wall Remote within direct range of your Z-Wave hub.  
    
  2. Put the Z-Wave hub into exclusion mode (not sure how to do that? ask@getzooz.com).  
    
  3. Click the middle button 6 times very quickly  
    
  4. Your hub will confirm exclusion and the device will disappear from your controller's device list.

### Wakeup Information

The ZEN37 800LR does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


You will need to wake the Remote Switch up when changing any advanced settings or assigning any new scenes or actions to it.

Click the lower left button 6 times as quickly as possible to wake the device up. The LED indicator will stay on solid blue during wake-up and will turn off when the device turns the Z-Wave radio off again.

### General Usage Information

There are 4 buttons on the remote. Each one allows for single-, or multi-, presses to achieve different scenes. The manual discusses them as follows (each button affects a different scene number, as described in the manual; this example is for button 1 (the top button)):

  * TAP x 1 for Scene 1, pressed (or ON basic set for association Group 2; or toggle state with basic set association Group 6)  
    
  * TAP x 2, 3, 4, or 5 for Scene 1 multi-tap  
    
  * HOLD for Scene 1, held (or multilevel start level change for association Group 4, add brightness) RELEASE for Scene 1, released (or multilevel stop level change for Group 4)

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the ZEN37 800LR -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Scene Number | scene_number | scene_number |  | Number | 
| Alarm (power) | alarm_power | alarm_power | Energy | Switch | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | system.battery_level | Battery | Number |

### Scene Number
Triggers when a scene button is pressed.

The ```scene_number``` channel is of type ```scene_number``` and supports the ```Number``` item.
This channel provides the scene, and the event as a decimal value in the form ```<scene>.<event>```. The scene number is set by the device, and the event is as follows -:

| Event ID | Event Description  |
|----------|--------------------|
| 0        | Single key press   |
| 1        | Key released       |
| 2        | Key held down      |
| 3        | Double keypress    |
| 4        | Tripple keypress   |
| 5        | 4 x keypress       |
| 6        | 5 x keypress       |

### Alarm (power)
Indicates if a power alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_power``` channel is of type ```alarm_power``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.

Values in the range 0 to 99 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```5```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_7_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZEN37 800LR supports 9 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Basic Set Lifeline to Hub

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Basic for Large Buttons

Basic Group for ON/OFF via Large Buttons
This group is for the ON action using Large Button 1 (the top large button), or the OFF action using Large Button 2 (the lower large button)

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Basic for Small Buttons

Basic Group for ON/OFF via Small Buttons
This group is for the ON action using Button 3 (the lower left small button), or the OFF action using Button 4 (the lower right small button)
