The ZSE43 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The ZSE43 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

Battery Powered Tilt / Shock sensor

  * Tilt monitoring for garage doors and gates: quick open/close reports you can depend on sent to your Z-Wave system for both vertical and horizontal tilt movement (NOT suitable for swinging gates or doors)
  * Shock sensor: monitor window glass and other surfaces for vibration to improve security of your home

### Inclusion Information

  1. Put the Z-Wave hub into inclusion/pairing mode (see your hub's manual for instructions since each brand is different)
  2. Click the Z-Wave button 3 times quickly (button inside cover by battery)
  3. The new device should appear on your hub's device list

### Exclusion Information

  1. Bring the Sensor within 3 feet of your Z-Wave hub 
  2. Put your Z-Wave hub into exclusion mode (see your controller's manual for details, as each brand is different)
  3. Click the Z-Wave button 3 times quickly (button inside cover by battery)
  4. Your hub should confirm exclusion and the sensor will disappear from the interface

### Wakeup Information

The ZSE43 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


Click the Z-Wave button 4 times quickly to wake the sensor up manually. The LED indicator will flash twice to confirm the device is awake. During wake-up, the sensor turns the Z-Wave radio on for one minute to receive communication from the hub. 

### General Usage Information



## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the ZSE43 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Binary Sensor | sensor_binary | sensor_binary |  | Switch | 
| Alarm (access) | alarm_access | alarm_access | Door | Switch | 
| Alarm (burglar) | alarm_burglar | alarm_burglar | Door | Switch | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | system.battery_level | Battery | Number |

### Binary Sensor
Indicates if a sensor has triggered.

The ```sensor_binary``` channel is of type ```sensor_binary``` and supports the ```Switch``` item. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| ON | Triggered |
| OFF | Untriggered |

### Alarm (access)
Indicates if the access control alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_access``` channel is of type ```alarm_access``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Door``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |

### Alarm (burglar)
Indicates if the burglar alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_burglar``` channel is of type ```alarm_burglar``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Door``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```3```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_9_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZSE43 supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline to hub


Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Basic set for open / close (tilt sensor)


Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Basic set for vibration / no vibration (shock sensor)


Association group 3 supports 4 nodes.
