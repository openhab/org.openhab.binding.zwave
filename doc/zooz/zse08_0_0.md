### Wakeup Information

The ZSE08 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


<p&gtIf you change settings and parameters for the sensor, you may need to wake it up manually for the changes to be recorded. Press and release the Z-Wave button ONCE to wake the device up. The LED indicator will flash ONCE. The sensor’s wake-up interval is set to 12 hours by default to save battery life. Though not recommended, you can change the wake-up interval using your controller’s advanced settings if available. Minimum value: 300s (5 minutes), maximum value: 16,777,200s (around 194 days). Accepted values need to match minute intervals, so 300, 360, 420, etc.</p&gt

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the ZSE08 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Door / Window Status | sensor_door | sensor_door | Door | Contact | 
| Alarm (access) | alarm_access | alarm_access | Door | Switch | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | system.battery_level | Battery | Number |

### Door / Window Status
Indicates if the door/window is open or closed.

The ```sensor_door``` channel is of type ```sensor_door``` and supports the ```Contact``` item and is in the ```Door``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Contact``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OPEN | Open |
| CLOSED | Closed |

### Alarm (access)
Indicates if the access control alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_access``` channel is of type ```alarm_access``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Door``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.


## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 2 configuration parameters available in the ZSE08.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Close Delay | Delay (in seconds) before close signal will be sent |
| 2 | Trigger Value | The value that will be set when the sensor is triggered |
|  | Wakeup Interval | Sets the interval at which the device will accept commands from the controller |
|  | Wakeup Node | Sets the node ID of the device to receive the wakeup notifications |

### Parameter 1: Close Delay

Delay (in seconds) before close signal will be sent
<p&gtSet the delay time for turning associated devices OFF based on status change of your Contact Sensor. The number entered as the value corresponds to the number of seconds. So if 0 is entered by default, the Contact Sensor will report status change and trigger an associated device to turn off instantly, without any delay. If you change this setting to 10, the sensor will only trigger the associated device after 10 seconds the status change is reported - if your door or window is closed, the light will not go off for another 10 seconds.</p&gt
Values in the range 0 to 65535 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Trigger Value

The value that will be set when the sensor is triggered
<p&gtYou can choose if your Contact Sensor turns an associated device on or off when sending the basic set command. Use value 0 to turn the associated device OFF and value 255 to turn it ON. Adjust brightness level for a Z-Wave dimmer (Multilevel switch) by putting in any value between 1 and 99.</p&gt <p&gtValues: 0 – OFF; 1 – 99 (% of light); 255 – ON (default).</p&gt
Values in the range 0 to 255 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```255```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZSE08 supports 4 association groups.

### Group 1: Status

Lifeline
<p&gtGroup 1 for lifeline communication of open / closed status to Z-Wave controller. Supported command classes:</p&gt <ul&gt<li&gtNOTIFICATION\_REPORT</li&gt <li&gtBATTERY\_REPORT</li&gt <li&gtSENSOR\_BINARY\_REPORT</li&gt <li&gtDEVICE\_RESET\_LOCALLY_NOTIFICATION</li&gt </ul&gt

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Control

Control a device based on the sensor's value
<p&gtGroup 2 for control command communication to associated Z-Wave devices in the network. Use parameter 1 and parameter 2 to configure this group’s settings. Supported command classes:</p&gt <ul&gt<li&gtBASIC_SET</li&gt </ul&gt

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Notification

Notification Report for the status of the sensor
<p&gtGroup 3 for notifications to Z-Wave devices associated in this group. Supported command classes:</p&gt <ul&gt<li&gtNOTIFICATION_REPORT</li&gt </ul&gt

Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 4: Binary Report

Sensor Binary Report for the status of the sensor
<p&gtGroup 4 for notifications to Z-Wave devices associated in this group. Supported command classes:</p&gt <ul&gt<li&gtSENSOR\_BINARY\_REPORT</li&gt </ul&gt
