## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZEN14 supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Lifeline Group
The Double Outdoor Plug supports Group 1 for Lifeline communication 

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Group 2

Outlet 1 Association Group
The Double Outdoor Plug supports Group 2 with up to 2 devices for basic on/off control. This device will send a Basic Set command to Group 2 when outlet 1 changes its on/off status.

Association group 2 supports 2 nodes.

### Group 3: Group 3

Outlet 2 Association Group
The Double Outdoor Plug supports Group 3 with up to 2 devices for basic on/off control. This dev ice will send a Basic Set command to Group 3 whenever outlet 2 changes its on/off status .

Association group 3 supports 2 nodes.
