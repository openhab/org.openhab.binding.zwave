The ZEN54 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

  * Z-Wave 0-10 V dimming control for LED fixtures
  * Great for 0-10 V LED drivers in LED panels
  * Smooth dimming with instant status updates
  * Installs behind your existing wall switch (on/off or momentary)
  * 700 series Z-Wave chip for better range and faster control
  * Z-Wave Long Range for ultra reliable no-mesh communication
  * Advanced configuration including min and max brightness
  * Built-in Z-Wave signal repeater for boosted communication
  * SmartStart and S2 Security for a safer network

### Inclusion Information

Initiate inclusion (pairing) in the app (or web interface).

Tap the Z-WAVE button 3 times quickly if using traditional Z-Wave inclusion.

The LED indicator will blink green to signal communication and turn green for 2 seconds if inclusion is successful or turn red for 2 seconds if the pairing attempt fails.

### Exclusion Information

Bring your Z-Wave gateway (hub) close to the relay if possible

Put the Z-Wave hub into exclusion mode (not sure how to do that? ask@getzooz.com)

Click the on the relay 3 times quickly (theZ-Wave button LED indicator will start blinking green)

Your hub will confirm exclusion, the LED indicator on the relay will turn green for 2 seconds, and the device will disappear from your controller's device list.

### General Usage Information

3 x tap: enter inclusion (pairing) or exclusion mode  


2 x tap and hold (the third time) for 15 seconds: factory reset
