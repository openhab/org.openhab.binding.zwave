The ZSE40 v2 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The ZSE40 v2 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

  * 4 smart sensors in 1 compact device
  * 7 levels of motion sensitivity to choose from
  * 3 modes for motion / temp led indicator notifications
  * Built-in tamper protection
  * Low battery alerts
  * Z-Wave Plus with improved 500 chip for faster and safer wireless communication
  * Security enabled Z-Wave device with AES signal encryption

**Factory Reset**

If your primary controller is missing or inoperable, you may need to reset the device to factory settings. To complete the reset process manually, remove the back cover to trigger tamper switch. Press and release the Z-Wave button 10 TIMES quickly (within 10 seconds).

NOTE: All previously recorded activity and custom settings will be erased from the device’s memory.

### Inclusion Information

  1. Install the batteries and bring the 4-in-1 sensor as close to your Z-Wave gateway controller as possible
  2. Put your Z-Wave controller in inclusion mode
  3. Press and release the Z-Wave button TWICE quickly. The sensor will enter secure inclusion mode.
  4. A new 4-in-1 sensor should appear on your controller’s device list

Q: I have not been able to add the device to my network after several attempts, what do I do now?

A: If you are unable to include the Z-Wave sensor to your controller, please try one of the following:

  * Bring the 4-in-1 sensor closer to your Z-Wave controller
  * Press and release the Z-Wave button quickly several times once you put the controller in the inclusion mode to ensure the command has gone through
  * Put your controller in the EXCLUSION mode and press and release the Z-Wave button, then try adding it to your network again

**Initialization/Inclusion Issues**

If the unit does not initialize on initial inclusion (i.e., appears to be an unknown device), ask openHAB 2 to reinitialize the device (e.g., in PaperUI, via Configuration > Things > [Name] > Edit) and immediately press the Z-Wave button on the unit (e.g., right after saving your changes in PaperUI).

### Exclusion Information

  1. Bring the 4-in-1 sensor as close to your Z-Wave gateway controller as possible
  2. Put your Z-Wave controller in exclusion mode
  3. Press and release the Z-Wave button TWICE quickly
  4. The device should disappear from your controller’s device list.

The led indicator will flash 3 times when you take the batteries out and put them back in to indicate the device has been successfully excluded. Please repeat the process following all steps carefully if the led indicator blinks only once when you re-insert the batteries

### Wakeup Information

The ZSE40 v2 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


Use the Wake Up command to set wake-up interval for the sensor (from 10 minutes to 1 week) to report back to the controller. You can also press and release the Z-Wave button once to wake the device up manually.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Celsius).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Temperature Sensitivity

Amount the temperature must change before a report is sent
Use this setting to set a range for how much the temperature needs to change for it to be reported by the sensor

Values: 1 - 50. Values are in 1/10 of a degree C, so 1 is 0.1 degree and 50 is 5 degrees.

Default: 10 (1 degree). The sensor will report the new temperature value to the controller whenever the temperature goes up or down by 1 degree.

Use it to set trigger interval - the time when motion is reported again after initial trigger. Values: 15 - 255 where 1 stands for 1 second and 255 stands for 255 seconds. Default set to 15 seconds. NOTE: Small interval will increase activity and decrease battery life. 
Values in the range 15 to 255 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```15```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_5_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 6: Motion Sensor Sensitivity

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 1 | highest |
| 2 | higher |
| 3 | high |

| 7 | lowest |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```3``` (high).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_6_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 7: LED indicator mode

Select the LED indicator mode
LED indicator will flash every 3 minutes or whenever you press the Z-Wave button to indicate temperature level.

Green = under 60°F

Blue = 60°-75°F

Yellow = 75°-83°F

Purple = 83°-97°F

Red = over 97°F / motion detected / tamper switch triggered

| 4 | No Temperature, Flashing Motion |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```4``` (No Temperature, Flashing Motion).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_7_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZSE40 v2 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Receive sensor updates

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Group 2


Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.
