### Wakeup Information

The ZSE30 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


<p&gtIf you change settings and parameters for the sensor, you may need to wake it up manually for the changes to be recorded. Press and release the Z-Wave button THREE TIMES to wake the device up. The LED indicator will flash ONCE. The sensor’s wake-up interval is set to 12 hours by default to save battery life. Though not recommended, you can change the wake-up interval using your controller’s advanced settings if available. Minimum value: 300s (5 minutes), maximum value: 16,777,200s (around 194 days). Accepted values need to match minute intervals, so 300, 360, 420, etc</p&gt

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the ZSE30 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |

<p&gtEnable or disable water detection for the sensor by adjusting these parameter settings. Values: 0 – sensor disabled; 1 – sensor enabled (default setting). </p&gt
Values in the range 0 to 1 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_6_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 7: Trigger Action

Send command to associated device.
<p&gtYou can choose if your Water Sensor turns an associated device on or off when sending the basic set command. Use value 0 to turn the associated device OFF and value 255 to turn it ON. Adjust brightness level for a Z-Wave dimmer (Multilevel switch) by putting in any value between 1 and 99. Values: 0 – OFF; 1 – 99 (% of light); 255 – ON (default).</p&gt
Values in the range 0 to 255 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```255```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_7_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZSE30 supports 4 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
<p&gtGroup 1 for lifeline communication of water leak detection to Z-Wave controller. Supported command classes:</p&gt <ul&gt<li&gtNOTIFICATION\_REPORT\_V4</li&gt <li&gtBATTERY\_REPORT</li&gt <li&gtSENSOR\_BINARY\_REPORT\_V2</li&gt <li&gtDEVICE\_RESET\_LOCALLY_NOTIFICATION</li&gt </ul&gt

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Control Command

<p&gtGroup 2 for control command communication to associated Z-Wave devices in the network. Use parameter 7 to configure this group’s settings. Supported command classes: BASIC_SET</p&gt

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Notification Report

<p&gtGroup 3 for notifications to Z-Wave devices associated in this group. Supported command classes: NOTIFICATION\_REPORT\_V4 </p&gt

Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 4: Sensor Binary Report

<p&gtGroup 4 for notifications to Z-Wave devices associated in this group. Supported command classes: SENSOR\_BINARY\_REPORT_V2 </p&gt

Association group 4 supports 5 nodes.
