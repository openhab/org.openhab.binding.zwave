# ZEN51 Dry Contact Relay
This describes the Z-Wave device *ZEN51*, manufactured by *[Zooz](http://www.getzooz.com/)* with the thing type UID of ```zooz_zen51_00_000```.

The device is in the category of *Wall Switch*, defining Any device attached to the wall that controls a binary status of something, for ex. a light switch.

The ZEN51 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

On/off Z-Wave control for 120V and dry contact applications: great for lighting control or 120V load monitoring (sump pumps, motion lights)

700 series Z-Wave chip: greater coverage for a stronger mesh network

SmartStart and S2 authenticated security for a truly protected smart home

Installs behind the existing wall switch or at the fixture (if neutral is not available in the switch box)

### Inclusion Information

  1. Initiate inclusion (pairing) in the app (or web interface).
  2. Tap the Z-WAVE button 3 times quickly if using traditional Z-Wave inclusion.
  3. The LED indicator will blink green to signal communication and turn green for 2 seconds if inclusion is successful or turn red for 2 seconds if the pairing attempt fails.

### Exclusion Information

  1. Bring your Z-Wave gateway (hub) close to the relay if possible
  2. Put the Z-Wave hub into exclusion mode (not sure how to do that? ask@getzooz.com)
  3. Click the on the relay 3 times quickly (theZ-Wave button LED indicator will start blinking green)
  4. Your hub will confirm exclusion, the LED indicator on the relay will turn green for 2 seconds, and the device will disappear from your controller's device list.

Sends BASIC REPORT and SWITCH BINARY REPORT
Device will send BASIC REPORT and SWITCH BINARY REPORT

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.
