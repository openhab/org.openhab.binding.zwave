## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZEN32 supports 11 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Lifeline
Main button binary switch (Z-Wave) / basic set (button) lifeline to hub

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Basic Set (relay)

Basic Set
Main relay button basic set (pressed only, doesn’t send anything when switch turned on via hub)

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Multilevel (relay)

Multilevel
Main relay button multilevel (held)

Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 4: Basic Set (#1)

Association group 5 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 6: Basic Set (#2)

Basic Set
Small button #2 basic set (pressed)

Association group 6 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 7: Multilevel (#2)
