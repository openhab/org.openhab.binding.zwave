# SmoothRemote SmoothRemote
This describes the Z-Wave device *SmoothRemote*, manufactured by *INNOVUS* with the thing type UID of ```innovus_smoothremote_00_000```.

The device is in the category of *Remote Control*, defining Any portable or hand-held device that controls the status of something, e.g. remote control, keyfob etc..

The SmoothRemote does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

The company's Z-Wave product portfolio is rounded off with the "SmoothRemote" remote control. This allows all INNOVUS devices as well as other third-party Z-Wave devices to be conveniently controlled from the sofa. 

The application fields are virtually unlimited. For example, the lights in the entire house can be switched on or off from the living room, unnecessary consumers switched off, or the room temperature in other rooms lowered or increased. All processes can be conveniently and easily set up via the House Control System

### Inclusion Information

The remote can be added to or removed from a Z-Wave network by triple clicking the Shift button

### Exclusion Information

The remote can be added to or removed from a Z-Wave network by triple clicking the Shift button

### Wakeup Information

The SmoothRemote does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


It is possible to make the device send a Wake Up Notification clicking VIII button 4 times

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the SmoothRemote -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Battery Level | battery-level | system.battery_level | Battery | Number |

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.


## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 4 configuration parameters available in the SmoothRemote.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 0 | Button Press Time | Button Press Time |
| 1 | Button Multiple Press Time | Button Multiple Press Time |
| 2 | Button Hold Time | Button Hold Time |
| 3 | Network Update Interval | Network Update Interval |
|  | Wakeup Interval | Sets the interval at which the device will accept commands from the controller |
|  | Wakeup Node | Sets the node ID of the device to receive the wakeup notifications |

### Parameter 0: Button Press Time

Button Press Time
 Time for presses on a single button to register as seperate and not part of a sequence, measured in 0.01s.

0 is interpreted as a 1.

**Warning**: All Configuration values have serious effects on the functioning of the device and as such shouldn't be changed unless one is certain of the consequences.
Values in the range 0 to 255 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```50```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_0_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 1: Button Multiple Press Time

Button Multiple Press Time
Time for presses on multiple buttons to register as seperate and not part of a sequence, measured in 0.01 s.

0 is interpreted as a 1.

**Warning**: All Configuration values have serious effects on the functioning of the device and as such shouldn't be changed unless one is certain of the consequences.
Values in the range 0 to 255 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```100```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Button Hold Time

Button Hold Time
Time for presses to register as being held down in 0.01s.

0 is interpreted as a 1.

**Warning:** All Configuration values have serious effects on the functioning of the device and as such shouldn't be changed unless one is certain of the consequences. 
Values in the range 0 to 255 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```40```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: Network Update Interval

Network Update Interval
Time between network updates in 256 seconds. Disabled if 0.

**Warning:** All Configuration values have serious effects on the functioning of the device and as such shouldn't be changed unless one is certain of the consequences. 
Values in the range 0 to 65535 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```168```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The SmoothRemote supports 68 association groups.
