## Overview

Siren Alarm with ten different sounds.

### Inclusion Information

The siren alarm can be included to the Z-wave network by pressing on the code button.

  1. Disassemble the siren alarm and insert the battery into the siren alarm. Make sure the device is located within the direct range of the controller.
  2. Set the controller into the learning mode (see main controller’s operating manual).
  3. Quickly, triple click the code button, LED light will flash red.
  4. Siren alarm will be detected and included in the Z-Wave network.
  5. Wait for the main controller to configure the siren alarm.

### Exclusion Information

  1. Make sure the sensor is connected to power source.
  2. Set the main controller into the learning mode (see main controller’s operating manual).
  3. Quickly, triple click the code button, LED light will flash red for 5 times.
  4. Wait for the main controller to delete the sensor.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the NAS-AB01Z -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Switch | switch_binary | switch_binary | Switch | Switch | 
| Siren ON Mode | config_decimal | config_decimal |  | Number | 
| Alarm | alarm_general | alarm_general | Alarm | Switch | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | system.battery_level | Battery | Number |

### Switch
Switch the power on and off.

The ```switch_binary``` channel is of type ```switch_binary``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Switch``` category.

### Siren ON Mode
Configure default siren ON mode:

1 = Alarm Music Mode

2 = Door Bell Music

Generic class for configuration parameter.

The ```config_decimal``` channel is of type ```config_decimal``` and supports the ```Number``` item.

### Alarm
Indicates if an alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_general``` channel is of type ```alarm_general``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Alarm``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.
