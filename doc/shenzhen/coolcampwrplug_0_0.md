## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The NAS-WR01ZE supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Assigned to Plugs status - On/Off. Allows for receiving control command from trigger devices whenever the Plug is turned On or Off.
  * NOTIFICATION\_REPORT\_V4
  * METER\_REPORT\_V4
  * SWITCH\_BINARY\_REPORT
  * DEVICE\_RESET\_LOCALLY_NOTIFICATION

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Group 2

Sending control commands to associated devices. If current load is over the max current defined in parameter #3, the Plug will send a BASIC\_SET (0xFF) to associated devices. When current load is normal, plug will send a BASIC\_SET (0x00).
BASIC_SET

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Group 3

Send Notification to associated devices.
NOTIFICATION\_REPORT\_V4

Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.
