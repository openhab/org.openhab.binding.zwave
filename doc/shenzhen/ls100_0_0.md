The LS100 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The LS100 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

Water sensor is an intelligent security equipment that can transmit the Z-Wave network which has particular frequency. Different countries or areas, the radio frequency of Z-Wave is different. In the Z-Wave network communications, water sensor can work with any Z-Wave main controller. In the Z-Wave network communications, water sensor can send messages to the Z-Wave main controller, and realize association with other devices through the Z-Wave network. In the communication with the Z-Wave main controller, the water sensor can send messages to the Z-Wave main controller, but it can not receive messages from the Z-Wave main controller. When the water sensor is triggered, the LED light keeps on and the buzzer will make sound. The water sensor sends messages to the Z-Wave main controller at the same time, the Z-Wave main controller will display the current status of water sensor. Water sensor is battery powered, is small and can be installed easily.

### Inclusion Information

1. Disassemble the water sensor and insert a battery. Make sure the device is within range of the network controller.

2. Set controller into inclusion mode.

3. Quickly, triple click the button inside the sensor. The LED light will flash red 5 times.

4. Water sensor will be detected and included in the Z-Wave network.

5. Wait for the main controller to initialize the water sensor

### Exclusion Information

1. Disassemble the water sensor.

2. Set controller into exclusion mode.

3. Quickly, triple click the button inside the sensor. The LED light will flash red 5 times.

4. Wait for the controller to delete the sensor.

### Wakeup Information

The LS100 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


Press the internal button once to wake‐up the sensor and send a wake up notification to the controller. The Led will blink once.

|  | Wakeup Node | Sets the node ID of the device to receive the wakeup notifications |

### Parameter 1: Raised Alarm Duration

Max time the alarm should be raised for
The alarm is raised when a leak is detected. The buzzer will beep and the LED will turn on at a configurable interval until either the leak is no longer detected or the Alarm Duration Time is reached. When either condition is met, the alarm will no longer be raised.

Setting the duration to 0 will disable this limit and let the LED/beeping continue until the leak is no longer detected.
Values in the range 0 to 255 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```120```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Alarm Interval

Time between beeps
While the alarm is raised, this is the duration between the device emitting a beep and LED flash.
Values in the range 1 to 255 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: First Alarm On Duration

First beep duration
When an alarm is raised, the initial beep and flash can have a different duration than the subsequent beeps. 
Values in the range 1 to 255 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```60```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 4: Alarm On Duration

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Disabled |
| 1 | Enabled |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (Enabled).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_6_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 7: Basic Set Group

Define Basic Set Group
Basic Set groups allow the sensors to forward commands to other sensors in that group.

Example: If the sensor clears an active alarm, then it will forward that command to other sensors in the configured Basic Set group.
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 255 | None |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```255``` (None).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_7_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The LS100 supports 4 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Z-Wave Plus Lifeline Group

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Basic Set

Sends commands to other nodes
Sends commands to all nodes in a Basic Set group. The Basic Set group can be changed with the Basic Set Group property.

Example: If the sensor clears an active alarm, then it will forward that command to other sensors in the configured Basic Set group.

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Send Notifications

Sends NOTIFICATION_REPORT to others

Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 4: Send Sensor Report

Sends SENSOR\_BINARY\_REPORT to others

Association group 4 supports 5 nodes.
