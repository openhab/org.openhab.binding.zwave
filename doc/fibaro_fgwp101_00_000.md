... ON, will stop reacting to alarm frames and B-button push.  
"Always on" function turns the Plug into a power and energy meter.  
Also, connected device will not be turned off upon receiving an alarm  
frame from another Z-Wave device (parameter 35 will be ignored).  
In "Always on" mode, connected device may be turned off only after  
user defined power has been exceeded (parameter 70). In such a  
case, connected device can be turned on again by pushing the  
B-button or sending a control frame. By default, overload protection  
is inactive. Default setting: 1
