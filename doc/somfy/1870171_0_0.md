The ZDMI 1870171 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

The Somfy Z-Wave Digital Motor Interface (ZDMI) is a Z-Wave routing device that resides as a node within a designated Z-Wave control network. It receives Z-Wave transmissions and converts them to motor control commands for Somfy’s Sonesse 50 ILT2 (AC) motor and Sonesse 30 RS485 (DC) motor. The interface also receives feedback information from these motors and distributes it to the Z-Wave network.

### Inclusion Information

  1. Upon power-up, the INCLUSION LED will illuminate for five (5) seconds then turn off. When the LED turns off, press the SETUP button to verify motor movement.
  2. Select the inclusion command on your Z-Wave programmer or remote controller.
  3. Press the SETUP button to include the ZDMI in the network. Verify that the INCLUSION LED stays illuminated when the interface is included in the network.

### Exclusion Information

  1. Select the exclusion command on your Z-Wave programmer or remote controller.
  2. Press the SETUP button to exclude the ZDMI from the network. Verify that the INCLUSION LED turns off.

### General Usage Information

The ZDMI interface can be operated by 3rd party automation, handheld and PC based controllers, or by manually by pressing the SETUP button. The following convention is used when operating from either 3rd party automation or controllers:

  * Light ON = Window Covering UP, Light OFF = Window Covering DOWN.
  * Light DIM & BRIGHTEN = Window Covering Opened Percentage where 0% = Window Covering CLOSED at its lower limit, and 100% = Window Covering OPEN at its upper limit.
  * Lighting percentage values between 0% and 100% = 99 intermediate window covering positions.
