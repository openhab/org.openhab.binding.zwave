## Overview

The Somfy Z-Wave to Radio Technology Somfy Interface (ZRTSI) is a Z-Wave bridge controller that receives Z-Wave transmissions and translates them to motor control commands for Somfy's range of Radio Technology Somfy (RTS) motors. The ZRTSI resides as a bridge controller node within a Z-Wave Network and becomes a repeating node in the mesh network. The ZRTSI also features Network Wide Inclusion (NWI) which allows inclusion and exclusion to take advantage of the mesh topology of Z-Wave networks. Z-wave devices from all manufacturers can be used in the same network togethe
