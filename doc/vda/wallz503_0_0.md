The WallZ-503 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

# Vitrum Wireless Thermostat

## Features:

Touch operated button with RGB back-light. Based on Z-Wave ® 500 module for wider coverage and higher data rate. Very low power consumption in standby. Easy installation. Acoustic feedback at button press. Over-the-air firmware update.

### Inclusion Information

The device supports both Normal Inclusion and Network Wide Inclusion.

Follow the steps below to include the device into the network:

  1. Check the device is not already included in a Z-Wave network by pressing any button on the front panel: the LED button should blink with red colour shortly. Should the device be already included, follow the instructions below to excluded it from the network.
  2. Set the controller into “Inclusion Mode”. Refer to the controller documentation to set the controller into Inclusion mode.
  3. Set the device into Learn Mode by pressing and holding button No.1 (on the top left of the device) for longer than 4 seconds. The device will enter into inclusion mode by blinking magenta LED button No.1. Upon successful completion, the device LEDs will blink green three times.
  4. Should for any reasons the device fail the normal inclusion, the device turns to enter into the Network Wide Inclusion Mode up to 4 times. Any time the device enters into Wide Inclusion Mode, LED Button No.1 blinks Magenta.

### Exclusion Information

Before starting to exclude the device from the network set the controller into “Exclusion Mode”.

Please refer to the controller documentation to set the controller into Exclusion mode.

The device can be excluded from a network only if previously included. Check that by pressing a button on the front panel: the LED button should not blink with red colour shortly. Follow the steps below to exclude the device from the network:

  1. Press and hold button No.1 (on the top left of the front panel device) for around 6 seconds and after that press 3 times the same button shortly within 3 seconds.
  2. LED Button No.1 blinks red upon completely the device exclusion successfully.
  3. Check the device is removed from the network by pressing button No.1: the LED button blinks red shortly.

### General Usage Information

## Firmware Update

This device supports the firmware update which can be started from any certified Z-Wave controller supporting the Firmware Update Command Class version 3 and above. While updating the device works normally. Just when the firmware update completes, the device will be inactive for few seconds during self-programming and rebooting. During the reboot process, the local loads (if present) will be disengaged. Should the firmware update fail, the whole updating process must be restarted from the beginning. The updating will last from 10 to 30 minutes depending on the network traffic condition.

## Factory Reset

  1. Start the factory default procedure by pressing and holding the hidden button on the front end top-back of the device till the buzzer plays a long beep (5 s).
  2. Release the button and press it again till the buzzer plays a sequence of 3 short beeps.
  3. The device will revert to its factory default settings, blinking all LED buttons and rebooting. Do not disconnect the device from the power supply until reboot is completed. Configuration and settings are restored to default values. “Home ID” and “Node ID” will be cleared as well.

## ASSOCIATION/MULTICHANNEL ASSOCIATION

Association enables the device to control other nodes included in the same Z-Wave network for a maximum of 20 nodes for each button/group with max 10 endpoints per Node 

### Group 1 Lifeline Association

Max 20 associations available, Singlechannel or Multichannel. **Warning:** In order to enable a controller to receive notifications with a endpoint source address from a Multichannel device, the controller must be associated to the lifeline group with the Multichannel association command class. Example: if controller Node ID is 1, multichannel association must be set to the lifeline group 1 with controller nodeID(1) and endpoint(1)

### Group 2 Reserved

### Group 3 MAX\_NODES\_IN_GROUP 20

**MAX\_END\_POINTS per Node: 10** 

Single channel association is only for root device so if used in a Multichannel environment the source and destination endpoint are lost. Multichannel Association instead contains the Source Endpoint and the Destination Endpoint so the device is addressed correctly

### General Rule for Groups

Each button has a dedicated group starting from #3 so button #1 is referred to Group 3, button #2 will control all the devices associated into group number 4 and so on. The number of groups depends on the number of endpoints (buttons). See table below for group association to buttons.

Messages sent by each group to associated devices are related to the “configuration type” of the endpoints
