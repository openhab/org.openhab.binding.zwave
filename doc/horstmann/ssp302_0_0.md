The SSP302 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

ON/OFF module with energy metering

### Inclusion Information

To include the SSP 302 onto a network, put the controller into inclusion mode. Now, press and hold the button on SSP 302 for 4 to 7 seconds then release. The network status LED will start flashing (twice per second) on successful start of inclusion process.

Note: Refer to the controller's manual for controller relevant actions.

On successful inclusion the LED will turn off.

Note: Inclusion means add and exclusion means delete.  
  
The total process can take up to 20 seconds (Refer to the “Technical specifications – Radio” section for details). If the device fails to join the network it will go back to factory default state and the Network status LED will start flashing once per second. If there is an issue with RF Communication, then re-locate the device and repeat the inclusion process again.

### Exclusion Information

To exclude the SSP 302 from a network, put the controller into exclusion mode (refer to controller instructions) and follow the same sequence as per the inclusion process for include node. After successful exclusion the network status LED will start flashing once per second, and the device will reset to factory default.

If exclusion fails, SSP 302 network status LED will turn off after about 5 seconds.

Note: Exclusion only works when the device is in direct range of the controller (no repeater allowed).

| Electric meter (power factor) | meter_powerfactor | meter_powerfactor | Energy | Number | 
| Electric meter (kVAh) | meter_kvah | meter_kvah | Energy | Number | 
| Electric meter (amps) | meter_current | meter_current | Energy | Number | 
| Electric meter (watts) | meter_watts | meter_watts | Energy | Number | 

### Switch
Switch the power on and off.

The ```switch_binary``` channel is of type ```switch_binary``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Switch``` category.

### Electric meter (volts)
Indicates the instantaneous voltage.

The ```meter_voltage``` channel is of type ```meter_voltage``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Electric meter (kWh)
Indicates the energy consumption (kWh).

The ```meter_kwh``` channel is of type ```meter_kwh``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Electric meter (power factor)
Indicates the instantaneous power factor.

The ```meter_powerfactor``` channel is of type ```meter_powerfactor``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Electric meter (kVAh)
Indicates the energy consumption (kVAh).

The ```meter_kvah``` channel is of type ```meter_kvah``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Electric meter (amps)
Indicates the instantaneous current consumption.

The ```meter_current``` channel is of type ```meter_current``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Electric meter (watts)
Indicates the instantaneous power consumption.

The ```meter_watts``` channel is of type ```meter_watts``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.



## Device Configuration

The device has no configuration parameters defined.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The device does not support associations.
