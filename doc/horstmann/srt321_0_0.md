The SRT321 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

The SRT321 is a wireless electronic battery powered room thermostat that uses interoperable two-way RF mesh networking technology to provide optimum comfort with close control of the energy used to heat the home without the need for additional wiring or unsightly cable runs.  
The SRT321 will only operate when 2 x AAA batteries have been fitted.

### Inclusion Information

  1. Set the number 1 DIL switch on the back of the SRT321 thermostat to the On (Up) position and the display on the SRT321 will change to show the letter ‘I’. If the letter ‘L’ appears, carry out stage 1A opposite.
  2. Power up the ASR-ZW receiver unit
  3. The network LED on the ASR-ZW receiver should be flashing.
  4. Press the dial on the front of the SRT321 thermostat once so that the ‘I’ in the display flashes.
  5. Press and hold the network button on the ASR-ZW receiver until the On indicator flashes (green) before the Off indicator  
    becomes solid red.
  6. After a few seconds the radio mast symbol will appear in the display along with the letters IP.
  7. Reset the number 1 DIL switch on the back of the SRT321 to the Off position and the temperature should return in the display

### Exclusion Information

Not provided through installation manual.

### Wakeup Information

The SRT321 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


  1. Turn the dial of the SRT321 until the letter P appears in the display.
  2. Press the dial twice.
  3. A second P should appear in the display which now shows \`PP’.
  4. Turn the dial until the letter ‘I’ appears in the display and return to the main instruction.

### Operating State
Sets the thermostat operating state.

The ```thermostat_state``` channel is of type ```thermostat_state``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Temperature``` category.
The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Number``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|

This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.


## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 3 configuration parameters available in the SRT321.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Enable Temperature Sensor | Controls the use of the temperature sensor on the device |
| 2 | Temperature Scale | Controls the temperature sensor scale |
| 3 | Delta T | Defines the temperature steps of the heating control. Steps are 0.1 K |
|  | Wakeup Interval | Sets the interval at which the device will accept commands from the controller |
|  | Wakeup Node | Sets the node ID of the device to receive the wakeup notifications |

### Parameter 1: Enable Temperature Sensor

Controls the use of the temperature sensor on the device

The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Disable |
| 255 | Enable |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```255``` (Enable).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Temperature Scale

Controls the temperature sensor scale

The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Celsius |
| 255 | Fahrenheit |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Celsius).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: Delta T

Defines the temperature steps of the heating control. Steps are 0.1 K

Values in the range 0 to 255 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```10```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The SRT321 supports 6 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Thermostat Mode Control


Association group 2 supports 4 nodes.

### Group 3: Switch Control


Association group 3 supports 4 nodes.

### Group 4: Battery Info


Association group 4 supports 4 nodes.

### Group 5: Thermostat Set Point


Association group 5 supports 4 nodes.

### Group 6: Air Temperature


Association group 6 supports 4 nodes.
