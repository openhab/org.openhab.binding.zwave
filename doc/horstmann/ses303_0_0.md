# SES 303 Temperature and humidity sensor
This describes the Z-Wave device *SES 303*, manufactured by *Horstmann Controls Limited* with the thing type UID of ```horstmann_ses303_00_000```.

The device is in the category of Sensor, defining Device used to measure something.

# Overview

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the SES 303

| Channel | Channel Id | Category | Item Type |
|---------|------------|----------|-----------|
| Sensor (temperature) | sensor_temperature | Temperature | Number | 
| Sensor (relative humidity) | sensor_relhumidity | Humidity | Number | 

### Sensor (temperature)

Indicates the current temperature

The ```sensor_temperature``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Temperature``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Sensor (relative humidity)

Indicates the current relative humidity

The ```sensor_relhumidity``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Humidity``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.



## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 4 configuration parameters available in the SES 303.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Delta Temp | Precision of measured temperature (delta) |
| 2 | Temp Reporting Interval | Reporting interval in minutes |
| 3 | Delta Humidity | Precision of measured humidity (delta) |
| 4 | Humidity Reporting Interval | Reporting interval in minutes |

### Parameter 1: Delta Temp

Precision of measured temperature (delta)
Configuration value : Desired value / Resolution. (Resolution = 0.1)

**Example**: To configure Delta temperature to 2 °C, the value needed to be configured in device is 2/0.1 = 20.

  
**IMPORTANT**: Controllers may only allow configuring signed values. In order to set values in the range 128...255, the value sent in the application shall be equal to desired value minus 256. For example, to set Delta Temperature to 130, it may be needed to set a value 130−256=−126.

Zero configuration means that the corresponding functionality is disabled.
Values in the range 0 to 255 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is 0.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Temp Reporting Interval

Reporting interval in minutes
**IMPORTANT**: Controllers may only allow configuring signed values. In order to set values in the range 128...255, the value sent in the application shall be equal to desired value minus 256. For example, to set Delta Temperature to 130, it may be needed to set a value 130−256=−126.

Zero configuration means that the corresponding functionality is disabled.
Values in the range 0 to 255 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is 5.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: Delta Humidity

Precision of measured humidity (delta)
Configuration value : Desired value / Resolution. (Resolution = 0.1)

**Example**: To configure Delta temperature to 2 °C, the value needed to be configured in device is 2/0.1 = 20.

**IMPORTANT**: Controllers may only allow configuring signed values. In order to set values in the range 128...255, the value sent in the application shall be equal to desired value minus 256. For example, to set Delta Temperature to 130, it may be needed to set a value 130−256=−126.

Zero configuration means that the corresponding functionality is disabled.
Values in the range 0 to 255 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is 5.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 4: Humidity Reporting Interval

Reporting interval in minutes
**IMPORTANT**: Controllers may only allow configuring signed values. In order to set values in the range 128...255, the value sent in the application shall be equal to desired value minus 256. For example, to set Delta Temperature to 130, it may be needed to set a value 130−256=−126.

Zero configuration means that the corresponding functionality is disabled.
Values in the range 0 to 255 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is 5.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_4_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The device does not support associations.
