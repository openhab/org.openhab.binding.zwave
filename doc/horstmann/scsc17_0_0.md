## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 4 configuration parameters available in the SCSC-17.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Temperature Scale | Controls the temperature sensor scale |
| 2 | Lower temperature limit | Defines the minimum temperature. Steps are 1C |
| 3 | Upper temperature limit | Defines the maximum temperature. Steps are 1C |
| 4 | Delta T | Defines the temperature steps of the heating control value is 0.1 °С.  
1 0.1 ̊C / ̊F - 50 0.1 ̊C / ̊F |

### Parameter 1: Temperature Scale

Controls the temperature sensor scale

The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The SCSC-17 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Reports


This group supports 1 nodes.

### Group 2: Control


This group supports 4 nodes.
