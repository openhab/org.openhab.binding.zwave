The 10002041-13X supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

Once plugged to 10002432-039 this front permits the direct control of a load plugged toggling it each time that the pushbutton is pressed. It is also possible to control the load using Z- Wave devices.

### Inclusion Information

KeyPad long press (2s<t<30s) -> Central LED blinks until release of Pushbutton -> The Node Information Frame is sent via Z- Wave.

### Exclusion Information

KeyPad long press (2s<t<30s) -> Central LED blinks until release of Pushbutton -> The Node Information Frame is sent via Z- Wave.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The 10002041-13X supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Group 1 (Lifeline) -> Name “lifeline”
COMMAND\_CLASS\_BASIC_REPORT

It is sent to the associated nodes when the load changes state:

  * ON -> 0xFF
  * OFF -> 0x00

COMMAND\_CLASS\_METER\_REPORT\_V4

It is sent to the associated nodes when the power consumed varies more than 10%

“Electric meter”, “Consumed”, “Watts”, Size 4, Precision 1, Value (W)

COMMAND\_CLASS\_DEVICE\_RESET\_LOCALLY_ NOTIFICATION

The associated nodes are sent when the device is deleted from the Z-Wave network

Association group 1 supports 3 nodes.

### Group 2: Group 2

Group 2 (Control) -> Name “ctrl"
COMMAND\_CLASS\_BASIC_REPORT

It is sent to the associated nodes when the load changes state:

  * ON -> 0xFF
  * OFF -> 0x00

Association group 2 supports 20 nodes.
