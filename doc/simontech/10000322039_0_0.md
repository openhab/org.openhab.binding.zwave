The 10002034-13X supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

Simon Electronic Switch IO integrated by Electronic Switch that provides power Switch and Rocker that provides Z-Wave communication attributes.

### Inclusion Information

  1. Put controller into inclusion mode.
  2. When the pushbutton is released after a press of (2sec<T<20sec) the device will send a NIF to include the device to the Z-Wave network. Main LED will blink with 0,3 sec period.

### Exclusion Information

  1. Put controller into exclusion mode.
  2. When the pushbutton is released after a press of (2sec<T<20sec) the device will send a NIF to exclude the device from the Z-Wave network. Main LED will blink with 0,3 sec period.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the 10002034-13X -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Switch | switch_binary | switch_binary | Switch | Switch | 
| Electric meter (watts) | meter_watts | meter_watts | Energy | Number | 

### Switch
Switch the power on and off.

The ```switch_binary``` channel is of type ```switch_binary``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Switch``` category.

### Electric meter (watts)
Indicates the instantaneous power consumption.

The ```meter_watts``` channel is of type ```meter_watts``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

Values in the range 0 to 254 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_16_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The 10002034-13X supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 3 nodes.
