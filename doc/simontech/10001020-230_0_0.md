## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The 10001020-230 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
On/Off Report when load state is changed:

On -> CC Basic, Basic Report, Value 0x01 - 0x63 Report the dimming level

Off -> CC Basic, Basic Report, Value 0x00

Instant Power Consumption vary over 10% and is stable almost 2sec:

CC Meter, Meter Report, “Electric meter”, “Consumed”, “Watts”, Size 4, Precision 1, Value (W)

Calibration requirement change. (If device needs to be calibrated and is Added into a Z-Wave network, it will report after receive an Association Set of life line).

Calibration required -> CC Configuration, Configuration Report, Param 23, Value 0xFF

Calibration not required -> CC Configuration, Configuration Report, Param 23, Value 0x00

After reset the Z-Wave module, a DEVICE-RESET-LOCALLY-NOTIFICATION is sent.

Association group 1 supports 3 nodes.

### Group 2: CTRL

On/Off Report when load state is changed:

On -> CC Basic, Basic Report, Value 0x01 - 0x63 Report the dimming level

Off -> CC Basic, Basic Report, Value 0x00

Association group 2 supports 20 nodes.
