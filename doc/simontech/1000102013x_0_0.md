The 10001020-13X supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

The electronic dimmer switch 230V ~ with 2/3 wire phase cut is a switch from Simon 100 serie. These types of dimmer switches have a power of 50W to 240W for traditional loads and 9W to 100W for LED loads. This is highly recommended for all types of uses (domestic, hotels, hospitals ...). The dimmer switch is only compatible with Simon 100 frames.

### Inclusion Information

  1. Put controller into inclusion mode.
  2. When the pushbutton is released after a press of (2sec<T<20sec) the device will send a NIF to include the device to the Z-Wave network. Main LED will blink with 0,3 sec period.

### Exclusion Information

  1. Put controller into exclusionÂ mode.
  2. When the pushbutton is released after a press of (2sec<T<20sec) the device will send a NIF to include the device to the Z-Wave network. Main LED will blink with 0,3 sec period.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The 10001020-13X supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
On/Off Report when load state is changed:

  * On -> CC Basic, Basic Report, Value 0x01 - 0x63 Report the dimming level
  * Off -> CC Basic, Basic Report, Value 0x00

Instant Power Consumption vary over 10% and is stable almost 2sec:

  * CC Meter, Meter Report, âElectric meterâ, âConsumedâ, âWattsâ, Size 4, Precision 1, Value (W)

Calibration requirement change. (If device needs to be calibrated and is Added into a Z-Wave network, it will report after receive an Association Set of life line).

  * Calibration required -> CC Configuration, Configuration Report, Param 23, Value 0xFF
  * Calibration not required -> CC Configuration, Configuration Report, Param 23, Value 0x00

After reset the Z-Wave module, a DEVICE-RESET-LOCALLY-NOTIFICATION is sent.

Association group 1 supports 3 nodes.

### Group 2: CTRL

On/Off Report when load state is changed:

  * On -> CC Basic, Basic Report, Value 0x01 - 0x63 Report the dimming level
  * Off -> CC Basic, Basic Report, Value 0x00

Association group 2 supports 20 nodes.
