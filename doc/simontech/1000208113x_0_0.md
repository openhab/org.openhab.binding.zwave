## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The 10002081-13X supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
LIFE
Change on Sunblind position:

On -> CC Basic, Basic Report.

Value 0x01 - 0x63 Report sunblind position

Calibration requirement change. (If device needs to be calibrated and is Added into a ZWave network, it will report after receive an Association Set of life line).

Calibration required -> CC Configuration, Configuration Report, Param 23, Value 0xF

Calibration not required -> CC Configuration, Configuration Report, Param 23, Value 0x00

Association group 1 supports 3 nodes.

### Group 1: Control

CONTROL
Change on Sunblind position:

CC Basic, Basic Report.

Value 0x00 - 0x63 Report sunblind position

Association group 1 supports 20 nodes.
