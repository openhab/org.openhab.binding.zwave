The FMS01 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

The Multifunction Switch is a Z-Wave Plus mains powered Wallbox mountable Wall Controller. It can be configured to control up to Four separate Light Zones or Central Scenes. Each Light Zone can consist of both Dimmers and Switches. The device can be combined with a Back Unit, which provide local Switch or Dimmer functionality.   
Room and Floor temperature sensors can also be connected to the device, which enables the device to function as a head-less Thermostat. The Thermostat is fully controllable from a Z-Wave Controller, and can control both a Local and Remote heating relay.

The Multifunction Switch is capable of controlling local loads via a modular Back Unit. The back unit can be mounted and connected to mains electricity inside a Electrical Wall box. Two types of Relay and Dimmer Back Units are currently available. The maximum controllable local load are specified in each Back Unit product sheets.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_34_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 36: Thermostat Control Resend Interval

Resend Interval in seconds
Defines the interval between each time the Thermostat will repeat its last control command. This is used in combination with the Relay Safety configuration when controlling external Relays. If the Thermostat should fail, it would then stop sending control commands which in turn means the Relay will turn itself OFF after the safety mode delay has expired. This insures that heating will not be left ON indefinitely in failure situations.

The default value is 5 minutes, which is OK for most electrical heating control. If used to control Water based heating, the value MUST be adjusted in accordance with the manufacturers specifications.
Values in the range 60 to 32767 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```300```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_37_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 38: Thermostat Floor Temp Max

Floor Temp Max in 1/10th of a degree Celcius
Max floor temperature if a local floor sensor is connected. If the Floor Sensor reads a temperature Higher than the configured value, it will immediately turn the relay (or any associated relays) OFF.

The relay will stay off until the temperature sinks below this value, and the Thermostat issues it's next control command. Disabled if zero (0) value, or if no floor sensor is connected. The value is given as 1/10th of a degree Celcius. Range: 0 – 500 (0-50 degrees).

NOTE! MAX 27 degrees is recommended for Wooden Floors!

NOTE! This function is always active as long as a Floor Sensor is connected, regardless of the sensor configuration described below.
Values in the range 0 to 500 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```270```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_38_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 40: Temperature Sensor Select

Temperature Sensor Select
Defines which temperature Sensor should be used for Heating Control. The default value is Both (3), which should work well in most scenarios (even when only a Floor or Room sensor is present). If both a Room and Floor sensor is used, the Thermostat will always control heating based on the lowest temperature reading of the two, to insure a comfortable floor temperature even if the room is already warm enough. If this is not wanted, the Thermostat should be configured to use the Room sensor Only. NOTE! The Floor Max Temperature feature will ALWAYS be active as long as a floor sensor is available, even if the Thermostat is configured to only use the Room Sensor.

1 - Local Room - Use temperature from Locally connected Room sensor ONLY. Max Floor Temp protection is still active as long as a floor sensor is available.

2 - Local Floor - Use temperature from Locally connected Floor sensor ONLY  
3 - Both - Use temperature from Locally connected Floor AND Room sensor if available (Default).
Values in the range 1 to 3 may be set.
