The CT200X supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

## Overview

<p&gtThis thermostat is provided by Vivint, but can join a non-Vivint ZWave network.</p&gt

### Inclusion Information

<p&gtThe Vivint Element Thermostat is a Z-Wave® compliant thermostat. It has an onboard radio that can be added to an existing Z-Wave® network. This device can be used on a network with products from different vendors.</p&gt <ol&gt<li&gtSet your primary controller to INCLUDE mode to add the thermostat as a node on your network (see your specific controller’s User Manual for detailed instructions).</li&gt <li&gtThe Thermostat main screen shows a welcome message. Press the SIDE button to continue.</li&gt <li&gtPress the SIDE button to initiate the inclusion process. This initiates the network connection process. <ul&gt<li&gtIf inclusion fails, the screen says “Failed”. Press the SIDE button to try adding again.</li&gt </ul&gt</li&gt <li&gtWhen the Thermostat has been successfully included to a Z-Wave network, the screen displays a confirmation check mark. Press the SIDE button to continue. You can now configure the thermostat to work with your HVAC system.</li&gt <li&gtYour primary controller indicates that the thermostat was successfully added to its network (see your specific controller’s User Manual for details).</li&gt </ol&gt

### Exclusion Information

<p&gtThe Vivint Element can be excluded from the Z-Wave network process similar to the inclusion process. Set your primary controller to EXCLUDE.</p&gt

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The CT200X supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 2 nodes.
