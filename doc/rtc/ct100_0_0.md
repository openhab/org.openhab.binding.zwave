# Overview

## Channels
The following table summarises the channels available for the CT100

| Channel | Channel Id | Category | Item Type |
|---------|------------|----------|-----------|
| Sensor (temperature) | sensor_temperature | Temperature | Number | 
| Thermostat mode | thermostat_mode | Temperature | Number | 
| Operating State | thermostat_state | Temperature | Number | 
| Setpoint (heating) | thermostat_setpoint | Temperature | Number | 
| Setpoint (cooling) | thermostat_setpoint | Temperature | Number | 
| Thermostat fan mode | thermostat_fanmode |  |  | 
| Thermostat fan state | thermostat_fanstate |  |  | 
| Time Offset | time_offset | Temperature | Number |

| Relative Humidity | sensor_relhumidity2 | Humidity | Number | 

### Sensor (temperature)
The ```sensor_temperature``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Temperature``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Thermostat mode
The ```thermostat_mode``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Temperature``` category.
The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Number``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| 0 | Off |
| 1 | Heat |
| 2 | Cool |
| 3 | Auto |
| 4 | Aux Heat |
| 5 | Resume |
| 6 | Fan Only |
| 7 | Furnace |
| 8 | Dry Air |
| 9 | Moist Air |
| 10 | Auto Changeover |
| 11 | Heat Economy |
| 12 | Cool Economy |
| 13 | Away |
| 15 | Full Power |
| 31 | Manufacturer Specific |

### Operating State
The ```thermostat_state``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Temperature``` category.
The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Number``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| 0 | Idle |
| 1 | Heating |
| 2 | Cooling |
| 3 | Fan Only |
| 4 | Pending Heat |
| 5 | Pending Cool |
| 6 | Vent / Economiser |

### Setpoint (heating)
The ```thermostat_setpoint``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Temperature``` category.

### Setpoint (cooling)
The ```thermostat_setpoint``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Temperature``` category.

### Thermostat fan mode
The ```thermostat_fanmode``` channel supports the `````` item.

### Thermostat fan state
The ```thermostat_fanstate``` channel supports the `````` item.

### Time Offset
The ```time_offset``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Temperature``` category.

### Sensor (temperature) 1
The ```sensor_temperature1``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Temperature``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Relative Humidity
The ```sensor_relhumidity2``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Humidity``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.



## Device Configuration
The following table provides a summary of the 0 configuration parameter available in the CT100.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|

## Association Groups
Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The CT100 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Group 1
Send report about Thermostat Mode, Thermostat Operating State, Fan Mode, Fan State, Setpoint, Sensor Multilevel
This group supports 2 nodes.
