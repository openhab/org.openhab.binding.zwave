The DS100 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

Vemmio Double Switch is a dual relay in-wall module. The product works as a transceiver and is a Z-Wave Plus enabled device. Mini size design lets the module be easily hidden into the wall box to do not interfere with house decoration. One of many uses of the Double Switch is to turn on or off the connected fittings and monitor power consumption in real time. The new smart relay calibration technology can work perfectly with many kinds of lights like: incandescent, fluorescent and LED lights.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The DS100 supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Group 2

For group 2, the Switch will report

  1. ON/OFF status of Relay1Â 
  2. Instant Power Consumption (Watt) of Relay1
  3. Accumulated Power Consumption (KWh) of Relay1 to Z-Wave Controller.

Association group 2 supports 1 node.

### Group 3: Group 3

For group 3, the Switch will report

  1. ON/OFF status of Relay2
  2. Instant Power Consumption (Watt) of Relay2
  3. Accumulated Power Consumption (KWh) of Relay2 to Z-Wave Controller.

Association group 3 supports 1 node.
