# ZEN06 Smart Plug with 2 USB ports

This describes the Z-Wave device *ZEN06*, manufactured by *Zooz* with the thing type UID of ```zooz_zen06_00_000```. 

Smart Plug with 2 USB ports  


## Overview 

### Product features:  

 *  Manual and remote on / off control 
 *  Energy monitoring 
 *  Scene inclusion for custom automation scenarios when included to a Z-Wave gateway controller 
 *  LED indicator displaying Z-Wave signal strength and power usage 
 *  Security enabled Z-Wave device with AES signal encryption (requires a security enabled gateway controller for full functionality) 
 *  Z-Wave Plus with improved 500 chip for faster and safer wireless communication 
 *  Built-in range extender for a stronger, more reliable network 
 *  2 USB charging ports for your smart phone or tablet (no Z-Wave functionality) 
 *  Built-in overload protection in Z-Wave outlet and USB ports 

### How to read LED indicator colors? 

 *  Burgundy = Smart Plug is off
 *  Blue = 0 – 300 W
 *  Cyan = 300 – 600 W
 *  Green = 600 – 900 W
 *  Yellow = 900 – 1200 W
 *  Red = 1200 – 1500 W
 *  Purple = 1500 – 1800 W
 *  Purple blink = over 1800 W

### How to test Z-Wave network range for my Smart Plug? 

You can easily check if the Smart Plug is within your Z-Wave controller’s range.

#### Here is how: 

Press and hold the Z-Wave button for 6 to 9 seconds until the LED indicator turns violet.

The LED indicator will then report signal strength.

 *  Flashing green = direct communication with the primary controller is established and still being diagnosed
 *  Solid green for 2 seconds = direct communication with the primary controller is stable
 *  Flashing orange = direct communication with the primary controller is intermittent and being diagnosed
 *  Solid orange = communication quality is fair
 *  Solid red = communication with the primary controller has failed
 *  Press and release the Z-Wave button to exit testing mode.

NOTE: This function may only be activated once the Smart Plug has been included to a ZWave network.
