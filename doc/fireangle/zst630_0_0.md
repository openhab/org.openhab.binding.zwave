The ZST-630 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The ZST-630 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

The ST-630 W2 thermoptek smoke alarm from FireAngel provides quick detection of slow-smouldering fires, making it ideal for areas where electrical equipment and upholstery furniture may become a fire hazard. Wirelessly interconnect up to 50 other W2 Module interlink devices within 35m.

### Inclusion Information

Triple-press the add button once the Z-Wave Module is on the device. The LED will show a quick blink once per second while the module is being added. This process may take as long as 30 seconds, but typically is much quicker. If you triple-press too quickly or too slowly, inclusion will not start. In this case wait a few seconds and then try again.

### Exclusion Information

Triple-press the button on the Z-Wave Module. The LED will show a quick double-blink once per second while the module is being removed. This process may take up to 30 seconds. If you triple-press too quickly or too slowly the removing function will not start. In this case you must wait a few seconds and then try again.

### Wakeup Information

The ZST-630 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


If the module has been successfully included, when pressing the button, the LED will flash three times. In addition, the module will communicate with the Z-Wave Controller, accepting any pending commands.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the ZST-630 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Smoke Alarm | alarm_smoke | alarm_smoke | Smoke | Switch | 
| Tamper Alarm | alarm_tamper | alarm_tamper |  | Switch | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | system.battery_level | Battery | Number |

### Smoke Alarm
Indicates if a smoke is triggered.

The ```alarm_smoke``` channel is of type ```alarm_smoke``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Smoke``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |

### Tamper Alarm
Indicates if the tamper alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_tamper``` channel is of type ```alarm_tamper``` and supports the ```Switch``` item. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.


## Device Configuration

The device has no configuration parameters defined.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZST-630 supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Z-Wave Plus Lifeline

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Basic Report


Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Notification Report


Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.
