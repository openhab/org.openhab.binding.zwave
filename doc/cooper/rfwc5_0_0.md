## Overview

The Z-Wave wall mount 5-scene keypad (RFWC5 & RFWC5D) serves as a flush mounted device for activating up to 5 scenes by manually pushing one of the five buttons on the face of the device. The scene keypad has 5 buttons, with LEDs, for turning individual scenes both ON and OFF. Each individual scene can be brightened or dimmed by pressing and holding any active (ON) scene’s corresponding button. The button located on the side of the device transmits an All-OFF command to only the devices associated with that scene controller. Scenes are a group of devices set to customized levels or states. The 5-scene keypad utilizes existing 120V/AC, 60Hz standard house wiring and fits in standard-sized wallboxes.
