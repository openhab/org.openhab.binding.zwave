The RF9642 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

Z-Wave Plus accessory dimmers can be paired with Z-Wave Plus universal smart dimmers to provide multi-location ON/OFF/BRIGHT/DIM control for up to (5) locations. These are ideal when thereâ€™s no traveler wire between the two locations in a 3-way application. Z-Wave Plus accessories will need to be associated with the load controlling dimmer using a compatible Z-Wave compliant controller Compatible with Z-Wave Plus universal dimmers (RF9640-N, RF9643-N) for wireless 3-way control, eliminating the need for traditional 3-way wiring or dedicated traveler wire

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The RF9642 supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Set

On/Off

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Dim

Up/Down

Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.
