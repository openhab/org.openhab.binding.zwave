The RF9518 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

The ASPIRE RF 8A switch (RF9518) replaces regular switches or dimmers to provide local and remote ON/OFF control for incandescent loads. Each switch can be manually controlled and remotely controlled by commands sent from an ASPIRE RF controller or other Z-Wave compatible controllers or programs. An ASPIRE RF switch utilizes existing 120V/AC, 60Hz standard house wiring and fits in a standard wallbox. No new wiring is needed.

### Inclusion Information

To include this device in a Z-Wave network, select the command on your Z-Wave controller for inclusion (Install, Add Device, Add Node, Include Device, etc.). Then press the RF switch ON/OFF switch one time to include it in the network. The LED will stop blinking.

### Exclusion Information

To exclude this device from a Z-Wave network, select the command on your Z-Wave controller for exclusion (Uninstall, Remove Device, Remove Node, Exclude Device, etc.). Then press the RF switch ON/OFF switch one time to exclude it from the network. The LED will start blinking.

## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 6 configuration parameters available in the RF9518.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Delayed off | Delayed off |
| 2 | Panic On Time | Panic On Time |
| 2 | Panic On Time | Panic On Time |
| 3 | Panic Off Time | Panic Off Time |
| 5 | Power Up State | Power Up State |
| 6 | Panic Mode Enable | Panic Mode Enable |
|  | Switch All Mode | Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands |

### Parameter 1: Delayed off

Delayed off
0 to 127 (decimal) represents 0 to 127 seconds of time. -128 to -1 (negative decimal numbers) represents 128 to 255 seconds as calculated by this formula:  
config value = desired time in seconds (or dedsired value) – 256 For an example of 172 seconds: config value = 172 – 256 = -84 (decimal) or 0xAC (hex)
Values in the range -128 to 127 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Panic On Time

Panic On Time
0 to 127 (decimal) represents 0 to 127 seconds of time. -128 to -1 (negative decimal numbers) represents 128 to 255 seconds as calculated by this formula:  
config value = desired time in seconds (or desired value) – 256 For an example of 172 seconds: config value = 172 – 256 = -84 (decimal) or 0xAC (hex)
Values in the range -128 to 127 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Panic On Time

Panic On Time
The configuration value is a signed single byte number This value may represent a value such as time.

**0 to 127 (decimal) represents 0 to 127 seconds of time.** 

-**128 to -1 (negative decimal numbers) represents 128 to 255 seconds** as calculated by this formula:

config value = desired time in seconds – 256

For an example of 172 seconds: config value = 172 – 256 = -84 (decimal) or 0xAC (hex)
Values in the range -128 to 127 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: Panic Off Time

Panic Off Time
0 to 127 (decimal) represents 0 to 127 seconds of time. -128 to -1 (negative decimal numbers) represents 128 to 255 seconds as calculated by this formula:  
config value = desired time in seconds (or desired value) – 256 For an example of 172 seconds: config value = 172 – 256 = -84 (decimal) or 0xAC (hex)
Values in the range -128 to 127 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.
