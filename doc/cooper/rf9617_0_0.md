The RF9617 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

Z-Wave Plus accessory switches can be paired with Z-Wave Plus wireless switches (RF9601) to provide multi-location ON/OFF control forup to (5) locations. These are ideal when thereâ€™s no traveler wire between the two locations in a 3-way application. Z-Wave Plus accessorieswill need to be associated with the load controlling switch using a compatible Z-Wave compliant controller.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The RF9617 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Set

On/Off

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.
