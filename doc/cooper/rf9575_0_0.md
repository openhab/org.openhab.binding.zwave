The RF9575 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

Anyplace switch controls Z-Wave receptacles, switches or dimmers to provide remote ON/OFF/DIM/BRIGHT control. This provides other programmable functions when used with Z-Wave compliant products. Anyplace switch is intended to manually control other Z-Wave devices through association with or without a controller. Anyplace switch utilizes two CR2025 batteries and mounts flush to the wall. No new wiring is required.

### Inclusion Information

Press the switch one time to include it in the network. The LED will stop blinking after the device is successfully included

### Exclusion Information

Press the switch one time to exclude it from the network.

### Wakeup Information

The RF9575 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the RF9575 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Dimmer | switch_dimmer | switch_dimmer | DimmableLight | Dimmer | 

### Dimmer
The brightness channel allows to control the brightness of a light.
            It is also possible to switch the light on and off.

The ```switch_dimmer``` channel is of type ```switch_dimmer``` and supports the ```Dimmer``` item and is in the ```DimmableLight``` category.



## Device Configuration

The device has no configuration parameters defined.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The RF9575 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.
