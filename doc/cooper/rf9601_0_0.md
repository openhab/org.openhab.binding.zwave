The RF9601 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

The Z-Wave Plus wireless switch replaces regular switches or dimmers (where a neutral is present) to provide local and remote ON/OFF control for LED, CFL, incandescent, magnetic low-voltage, electronic low-voltage, and fluorescent lighting loads. The Z-Wave Plus wireless switch provides other programmable functions (scenes, events, association, child lockout, etc.) when used with Z-Wave compliant controllers. Each switch can be manually and remotely controlled by commands sent from an Z-Wave controller or other Z-Wave compatible controllers. The switch could be also controlled by wired 3-way switch. Eaton’s Z-Wave switches are Z-Wave Plus certified. Eaton’s Z-Wave accessory switches are Z-Wave Plus certified and comply with latest S2 security standards for advanced cyber security.

### Inclusion Information

  1. This product may be added to a new or existing Z-Wave network. An Eaton Wiring Devices Z-Wave device has a blue LED, which will blink when the device is not included in a ZWave network. The LED stops blinking when the device is in a network.
  2. To include this device in a Z-Wave network, select the command on your Z Wave controller for inclusion (Install, Add Device, Add Node, Include Device, etc.). Then press the device switch one time to include it in the network.
  3. Based on the controller, the controller may ask to scan the QR code or manually enter 5 digit code under the QR code to install the device as a secured device
  4. After the device is added to the network, the LED will stop blinking

### Exclusion Information

To exclude this device from a Z-Wave network, select the command on your Z-Wave controller for exclusion (Uninstall, Remove Device, Remove Node, Exclude Device, etc.). Then press the device switch one time to exclude it from the network. The LED will start blinking.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The RF9601 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Set

On/Off

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.
