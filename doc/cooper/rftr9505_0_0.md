## Overview

The Aspire RF 15A split receptacle replaces regular receptacles to provide local and remote RF ON/OFF control of a single outlet. Moreover, the Aspire RF receptacle provides other programmable functions (scenes, events, association, child lockout, etc.) when used with Aspire RF or other Z-Wave® compliant controllers\*. The receptacle can be manually and remotely controlled by commands sent from an Aspire RF controller (RFHDCSG, RFTDCSG, RFTCP, RFUSB-PRO) or other Z-Wave compatible controllers or programs. An Aspire RF receptacle utilizes existing 120 V/AC 60Hz standard house wiring and fits into a standard wallbox. No new wiring needed.\*Note: some specific Aspire RF features may not be programmable
