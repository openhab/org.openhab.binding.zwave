## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The RF9537 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Group 1


Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 255: Group 255

Life line to the controller

Association group 255 supports 1 node.
