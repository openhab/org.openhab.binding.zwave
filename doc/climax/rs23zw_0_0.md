# RS-23-ZW Room Sensor
This describes the Z-Wave device *RS-23-ZW*, manufactured by *Climax Technology, Ltd.* with the thing type UID of ```climax_rs23zw_00_000```.

The device is in the category of *Motion Detector*, defining Motion sensors/detectors.

The RS-23-ZW supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The RS-23-ZW does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

The Room Sensor features both temperature and humidity detection function to monitor your home environments. The temperature and humidity information will be transmitted to the Z-Wave network and displayed on the Room Sensor’s LCD screen.

### Inclusion Information

  1. Remove the cover by loosening the fixing screw.
  2. Insert the 2 alkaline batteries into the battery compartment connecting the correct polarity as shown on the battery compartment lid to power on the Room Sensor.
  3. Put the Z-Wave gateway or Z-Wave Control Panel into Inclusion or Learning mode (please refer to the Z-wave gateway or Z-Wave Control Panel manual).
  4. Within 1.5 seconds, press the Function Button 3 times.
  5. Refer to the operation manual of the Z-Wave gateway or Z-Wave Control Panel to complete the learn-in process.
  6. If the sensor has already been included (learnt) into another Z-Wave Gateway/Z-Wave Control Panel, or if the sensor is unable to be learnt into the current Z-Wave Gateway/Z-Wave Control Panel, please exclude it first (see Exclusion) before attempting to include it into the current Z-Wave Gateway/Z-Wave Control Panel.

### Exclusion Information

  1. Put the Z-Wave gateway or Z-Wave Control Panel into Exclusion mode (please refer to the Z-Wave gateway or Z-Wave Control Panel manual).
  2. Within 1.5 seconds, press the Function Button 3 times and the Room Sensor will be removed from the Z-Wave network.

### Wakeup Information

The RS-23-ZW does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


The wake up time is programmed automatically according to Z-Wave Control Panel’s setting when The Room Sensor is included. The recommended setting of the wake up time is 60 minutes above.

### General Usage Information

  1. Remove the batteries from the Room Sensor first.
  2. Press and hold the Function Button. While holding the Function Button, power on the Room Sensor by re-inserting the batteries, wait for 10 seconds to factory reset.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the RS-23-ZW -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Sensor (temperature) | sensor_temperature | sensor_temperature | Temperature | Number:Temperature | 
| Sensor (relative humidity) | sensor_relhumidity | sensor_relhumidity | Humidity | Number | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | system.battery_level | Battery | Number |

### Sensor (temperature)
Indicates the current temperature.

The ```sensor_temperature``` channel is of type ```sensor_temperature``` and supports the ```Number:Temperature``` item and is in the ```Temperature``` category.

### Sensor (relative humidity)
Indicates the current relative humidity.

The ```sensor_relhumidity``` channel is of type ```sensor_relhumidity``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Humidity``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.


## Device Configuration

The device has no configuration parameters defined.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The RS-23-ZW supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Group 1 for “LifeLine”
Sensor Multilevel CC,V5 (COMMAND\_CLASS\_SENSOR_MULTILEVEL)

Battery CC (COMMAND\_CLASS\_BASIC)

Device Reset Locally CC

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Temperature Report

Group 2 for “Temperature Report”
Sensor Multilevel CC, v5 (COMMAND\_CLASS\_SENSOR_MULTILEVEL)

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Humidity Report

Group 3 for “Humidity Report”
Sensor Multilevel CC,V5 (COMMAND\_CLASS\_SENSOR_MULTILEVEL)

Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.
