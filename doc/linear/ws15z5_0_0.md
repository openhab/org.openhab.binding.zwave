The WS15Z5-1 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

The GoControl™ family of Z-Wave® certified wireless Lighting Products (smart LED fixtures, bulbs, switches, dimmers, outlets and plug-in modules) Control Products (thermostats, irrigation controller and garage door controller) and Sensors (flood, leak, alert sounder, motion sensor and door/window sensor) bring a new level of intelligent wireless Home Automation capability to commercial and residential environments.

The Z-Wave wireless protocol is an international wireless standard for remote home automation, security and other applications. This product can be included and operated in any Z-Wave network with other Z-Wave certified devices from other manufacturers and/or other applications. All non-battery operated nodes within the network will act as repeaters regardless of vendor to increase reliability of the network.

The WS15Z5-1 Wall Mount Switch allows remote ON/OFF control of loads connected to the switch, and is easily wired in place of a standard wall switch.

GoControl Z-Wave products are easy to install, are Z-Wave certified, and allow dealers to create an integrated wireless network with nearly limitless expansion and interoperability with security, energy management, home entertainment, appliances, and more.

DANGER! SHOCK HAZARD. Read and understand these instructions before installing. This device is intended for installation in accordance with the National Electric code and local regulations in the United States, or the Canadian Electrical Code and local regulations in Canada. It is recommended that a qualified electrician perform this installation. Make sure the load controlled by the switch does not exceed 1800 watts. For indoor use only. Retain instructions for future use.

The WS15Z5-1 contains a Z-Wave 500 Series Module that supports Z-Wave Plus® features. A Z-Wave certified portable or stationary Controller can communicate with the Z-Wave 500 Series Module.

Depending on the capability of the Controller or gateway software, the following operations can be performed with the WS15Z5-1. Refer to the Controller or gateway manual for details.

  * Turn the load ON and OFF.
  * Add or Remove the WS15Z5-1.
  * Assign the WS15Z5-1 to a specific Group/Scene and/or to include the load as part of ALL ON or ALL OFF system commands.
  * Over-the-air firmware update by the gateway or static Controller.
  * Lifeline function which automatically notifies the associated modules and the network that a manually reset device is no longer in the network, thus, the corresponding association becomes invalid.

### Inclusion Information

Refer to your Controller operating instructions to add this switch under the command of the Wireless Controller.

  1. With your Controller in Discovery or Add Mode, tap the switch. The LED will blink slowly when in ADD Mode.
  2. You should see an indication on your Controller that the “device was added” to the network and the LED will stop blinking.
  3. The device will appear in the list of Switches. It should display as a switch.

If the Controller/Gateway shows the addition failed, repeat Steps 1-3.

✓ NOTE: If you have trouble adding the WS15Z5-1 to a group it may be that the Home ID and Node ID were not cleared from it after testing. You must first “RESET UNIT” to remove it from the network. Although adding it to a group includes it in the network, removing it from a group does not remove it from the network. If removed from a group, it functions as a repeater (only). “RESET UNIT” removes it completely from the network.

### Exclusion Information

The WS15Z5-1 can be removed from the network by the Controller/Gateway. Refer to the Controller operating instructions for details.

  1. Set the Controller into Removal Mode and follow its instruction to delete the WS15Z5-1 from the Controller.
  2. Remove the switch by tapping the paddle 2 times. The LED will begin blinking slowly for 10 seconds indicating that it has been removed.
  3. You should see an indication on your Controller that the “device was removed” from the network.

### General Usage Information

Wire this switch in place of a current wall switch according to the diagram above. When used, WS15Z5-1’s are required to be wired to the same line (or neutral) which is also wired to the load being controlled, and not wired to any other neutral. If multiple neutrals are tied together in one box, separate the neutrals to preserve the integrity of the WS15Z5-1 circuit.

✓ CAUTION! Do not wire unit “live” (with power on the circuit).

The switch paddle on the WS15Z5-1 allows the user to:

  * Turn the attached load on or off.
  * Tapping top of switch turns the load attached ON.
  * Tapping bottom of switch turns the load attached OFF

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The WS15Z5-1 supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Lifeline (Group 1)
Group 1 is the “Lifeline” group and must be assigned the Node ID of the Z-Wave Controller to which unsolicited notifications from the WS15Z5-1 will be sent.

Group 1 supports a single Node ID. The Z-Wave Controller should set the Lifeline Association automatically after inclusion.

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Switch Group

Group for Switches (Group 2)
Group 2 nodes will be sent BASIC On/Off commands and is intended to control switches like the GoControl WS15Z5.

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Dimmer Group

Group for Dimmers (Group 3)
Group 3 nodes will be sent Multilevel Switch commands and is intended to control dimmers like the GoControl WD500Z5. 

Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.
