# WA00Z-1 Wall Mounted Switch
This describes the Z-Wave device *WA00Z-1*, manufactured by *Linear Corp* with the thing type UID of ```linear_wa00z1_00_000```.

The device is in the category of *Wall Switch*, defining Any device attached to the wall that controls a binary status of something, for ex. a light switch.

The WA00Z-1 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The WA00Z-1 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

The WA00Z-1 Wall Mounted Switch is simple to set up and can be installed anywhere to operate other load bearing Z-Wave devices. 

### Inclusion Information

Press either button on the WA00Z-1. The green LED should flash twice.

### Exclusion Information

Remove the switch by pressing either button on the WA00Z-1. The LED will flash twice indicating that it has been removed.

### Wakeup Information

The WA00Z-1 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


Tap the top switch five times in rapid succession.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the WA00Z-1 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Scene Number | scene_number | scene_number |  | Number | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | system.battery_level | Battery | Number |

### Scene Number
Triggers when a scene button is pressed.

The ```scene_number``` channel is of type ```scene_number``` and supports the ```Number``` item.
This channel provides the scene, and the event as a decimal value in the form ```<scene>.<event>```. The scene number is set by the device, and the event is as follows -:

| Event ID | Event Description  |
|----------|--------------------|
| 0        | Single key press   |
| 1        | Key released       |
| 2        | Key held down      |
| 3        | Double keypress    |
| 4        | Tripple keypress   |
| 5        | 4 x keypress       |
| 6        | 5 x keypress       |

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.


## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 3 configuration parameters available in the WA00Z-1.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Activation of Central Scene | Set top and bottom button scene numbers. |
| 2 | Control Mode | Control other devices or issue scene commands |
| 4 | Invert Switch | Invert top of switch ON/OFF buttons |
|  | Wakeup Interval | Sets the interval at which the device will accept commands from the controller |
|  | Wakeup Node | Sets the node ID of the device to receive the wakeup notifications |

### Parameter 1: Activation of Central Scene

Set top and bottom button scene numbers.
Z-Wave Plus introduces a new process for scene activation – “Central Scene  
Control”. Press and release the button, it will send a certain command to the  
central controller via the lifeline association group 1. This allows the controller  
to react to both a button press and a button release. This mode implements  
communication pattern 6, and requires a gateway supporting Z-Wave Plus.
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Top 1, bottom 2 |
| 1 | Top 3, bottom 4 |
| 2 | Top 5, bottom 6 |
| 3 | Top 7, bottom 8 |
| 4 | Top 9, bottom 10 |
| 99 | Top 199, bottom 200 |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Top 1, bottom 2).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Control Mode

Control other devices or issue scene commands
You can set the WA00Z-1 to control other devices or issue various scene activation commands to a central controller.
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Scene control + association groups |
| 1 | Scene control only |
| 2 | Associated devices only |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Scene control + association groups).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 4: Invert Switch

Invert top of switch ON/OFF buttons
To change the top of the switch to OFF and the bottom of the switch ON, set Parameter 4 to a value of 1.
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Top ON, bottom OFF |
| 1 | Bottom ON, top OFF |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Top ON, bottom OFF).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_4_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The WA00Z-1 supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Group 2


Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Group 3


Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.
