### Inclusion Information

<p&gtRefer to your Controller operating instructions to add this switch under the command of the Wireless Controller.</p&gt <ol&gt<li&gtWith your Controller in Discovery or Add Mode, tap the switch. The LED will blink slowly when in ADD Mode.</li&gt <li&gtYou should see an indication on your Controller that the “device was added” to the network and the LED will stop blinking.</li&gt <li&gtThe device will appear in the list of Switches. It should display as a switch.</li&gt </ol&gt<p&gtIf the Controller/Gateway shows the addition failed, repeat Steps 1-3.</p&gt <p&gt✓ <strong&gtNOTE</strong&gt: If you have trouble adding the WT00Z5-1 to a group it may be that the Home ID and Node ID were not cleared from it after testing. You must first “RESET UNIT” to remove it from the network. Although adding it to a group includes it in the network, removing it from a group does not remove it from the network. If removed from a group, it functions as a repeater (only). “RESET UNIT” removes it completely from the network.</p&gt <p&gt<strong&gtTo Reset Unit (If Required): </strong&gtIn the event that your primary Controller is lost or otherwise inoperable, to reset the WT00Z5-1 and clear all network information, follow these steps:</p&gt <ol&gt<li&gtTap the top of the switch five (5) times.</li&gt <li&gtPress and hold the bottom of the switch for 15 seconds. The LED will increasingly blink faster to indicate that a Reset is taking place.</li&gt </ol&gt

### Exclusion Information

<p&gtThe WT00Z5-1 can be removed from the network by the Controller/Gateway. Refer to the Controller operating instructions for details.</p&gt <ol&gt<li&gtSet the Controller into Removal Mode and follow its instruction to delete the WT00Z5-1 from the Controller.</li&gt <li&gtRemove the switch by tapping the paddle 2 times. The LED will begin blinking slowly for 10 seconds indicating that it has been removed.</li&gt <li&gtYou should see an indication on your Controller that the “device was removed” from the network.</li&gt </ol&gt

### General Usage Information

<p&gt<strong&gtSwitches</strong&gt</p&gt <p&gtThe paddle on the WT00Z5-1 allows the user to:</p&gt <ul&gt<li&gtTurn the Associated devices on or off.</li&gt <li&gtTapping top of switch turns the Associated device ON.</li&gt <li&gtTapping bottom of switch turns the Associated device OFF.</li&gt </ul&gt<p&gt<strong&gtDimmers</strong&gt</p&gt <p&gtThe paddle on the WT00Z5-1 allows the user to:</p&gt <ul&gt<li&gtDim the Associated devices.</li&gt <li&gtPress and Hold the top of switch to increase the intensity of the Associated device.</li&gt <li&gtPress and Hold the bottom of switch to decrease the intensity of the Associated device.</li&gt <li&gtTapping top of switch turns the Associated device ON to the previously set level.</li&gt <li&gtTapping bottom of switch turns the Associated device OFF.</li&gt </ul&gt<p&gt<strong&gtLED Indication</strong&gt</p&gt <p&gtTo act as a night light, the LED on the WT00Z5-1 will turn ON when the Associated device is OFF. However, the LED can be user configured to turn ON, when the Associated device is ON, if so desired. See “CONFIGURATION” section.</p&gt <p&gt<strong&gtRemote Control</strong&gt</p&gt <p&gtThe WT00Z5-1 will respond to BASIC and BINARY commands that are part of the Z-Wave system. Refer to your Controller’s instructions as to whether your Controller can transmit those commands.</p&gt <p&gt<strong&gtCreating Associations</strong&gt</p&gt <ol&gt<li&gtLearn all devices into the Z-Wave Hub.</li&gt <li&gtTap the paddle of the WT00Z5-1 four times quickly to enter Association mode.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The WT00Z5-1 supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
<p&gtGroup 1 is the “Lifeline” group and must be assigned the Node ID of the Z-Wave Controller to which unsolicited notifications from the WT00Z5-1 will be sent. Group 1 supports a single Node ID. The Z-Wave Controller should set the Lifeline Association automatically after inclusion. For instructions on how to set Associations, please refer to your Z-Wave Controller instructions. </p&gt

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Basic Switches

For control of on/off type switches
<p&gtGroup 2 nodes will be sent BASIC On/Off commands and is intended to control switches like the GoControl WS15Z5.</p&gt

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Dimmable Switches

For control of dimmable type switches
<p&gt Group 3 nodes will be sent Multilevel Switch commands and is intended to control dimmers like the GoControl WD500Z5.</p&gt

Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.
