### Inclusion Information

  1. Turn Off power to the light bulb socket
  2. Screw in the light bulb
  3. Place your network controller into inclusion mode by following the controller manufacturer's instructions
  4. Turn On power to the light bulb.  If successful, the LED light bulb will flash twice to indicate successful inclusion.
  5. If the controller/gateway shows it was a fail, repeat the procedure.

Note: If Inclusion still fails after the 2nd attempt, you need to first RESET the dt Smart Bulb before repeating the above steps.

### Exclusion Information

  1. Turn off power to the light bulb socket
  2. Follow the network controller instruction to place your network controller into exclusion mode to remove the dt light bulb from the network.
  3. After being prompted by the network controller, turn On power to the light bulb.  If successful, the LED light bulb will flash twice to indicate successful inclusion.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the Smart Retrofit Lighting Kit -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Dimmer | switch_dimmer | switch_dimmer | DimmableLight | Dimmer | 

### Dimmer
The brightness channel allows to control the brightness of a light.
            It is also possible to switch the light on and off.

The ```switch_dimmer``` channel is of type ```switch_dimmer``` and supports the ```Dimmer``` item and is in the ```DimmableLight``` category.



## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 3 configuration parameters available in the Smart Retrofit Lighting Kit.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Dim level when the light bulb is turned On | Turn Dim Level Memory ON/OFF |
| 9 | Dim / Bright Step Level | Dimming/Brightening Step Level |
| 10 | Dim / Bright Speed | How fast the brightness will change with each dimming step |
|  | Switch All Mode | Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands |

### Parameter 1: Dim level when the light bulb is turned On

Turn Dim Level Memory ON/OFF
The brightness level will be resume to full brightness when the dt Smart Bulb is turned ON every time.
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Disable dim level memory |
| 1 | Enable dim level memory |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Disable dim level memory).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 9: Dim / Bright Step Level

Dimming/Brightening Step Level
A low value provides gradual dimming and brightening, a high values makes it change rapidly.
Values in the range 1 to 99 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_9_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 10: Dim / Bright Speed

How fast the brightness will change with each dimming step

Values in the range 1 to 10 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```3```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_10_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Switch All Mode

Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands.

The following option values may be configured -:
| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Exclude from All On and All Off groups |
| 1 | Include in All On group |
| 2 | Include in All Off group |
| 255 | Include in All On and All Off groups |

This parameter has the configuration ID ```switchall_mode``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The Smart Retrofit Lighting Kit supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
LB65R6Z-1 supports Group 1 with up to ﬁve devices for lifeline communication. Group 1 must be assigned the Node ID of the controller to which unsolicited notiﬁcations will be sent. The Z-Wave controller should set this association automatically after inclusion. Lifeline association only supports the “manual reset” event. Please refer to the instructions manual of your remote controller or gateway for detail procedures on how these function can be set.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.
