The PS15EMZ51 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

The PS15EMZ5-1 is a plug in the wall device designed to automate the operation of most household devices, from lights to small household appliances. Supporting Energy Monitoring the PS15EMZ5-1 will provide both a visual indication of the amount of energy the connected device is using, and also transmit this information to the Z-Wave hub for tracking purposes. The long life LEDs will also act as a night light that your hub can turn off during daylight hours. The integrated button can be used to turn the connected device on / off, but it can also be temporarily disabled to eliminate the inadvertent operation of the device. With Over The Air upgrading supported, this device can be seamlessly updated to the most recent firmware and features.

### Inclusion Information

tap the button on the face of the outlet. 

The LED will blink slowly when in ADD Mode.

### Exclusion Information

Remove the switch by tapping the button on the face of the outlet 2 times. 

The LED will begin blinking slowly for 10 seconds indicating that it has been removed.

## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 3 configuration parameters available in the PS15EMZ51.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 2 | LED Intensity | LED Intensity |
| 3 | Night Light | Night Light |
| 13 | Energy Monitoring | Energy Monitoring |
|  | Switch All Mode | Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands |

### Parameter 2: LED Intensity

LED Intensity
100 = full brightness
Values in the range 0 to 100 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```100```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: Night Light

Night Light

The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | LED ON when the load is ON, |
| 1 | LED OFF when the load is on |
| 2 | LED is always ON |
| 3 | LED is always off |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```3``` (LED is always off).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 13: Energy Monitoring

Energy Monitoring
  * 0 Autmatic reporting OFF
  * 1-255 number of minutes between reports
Values in the range 0 to 255 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```6```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_13_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Switch All Mode

Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands.

The following option values may be configured -:
| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Exclude from All On and All Off groups |
| 1 | Include in All On group |
| 2 | Include in All Off group |
| 255 | Include in All On and All Off groups |

This parameter has the configuration ID ```switchall_mode``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The PS15EMZ51 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.
