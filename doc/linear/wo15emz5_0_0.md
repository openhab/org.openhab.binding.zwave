The WO15EMZ5-1 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

120 VAC 15 Amp Duplex Receptacle

### Inclusion Information

Refer to your Controller operating instructions to add this switch under the command of the Wireless Controller.

  1. With your Controller in Discovery or Add Mode, tap the button on the face of the outlet. The LED will blink slowly when in ADD Mode.
  2. You should see an indication on your Controller that the “device was added” to the network and the LED will stop blinking.
  3. The device will appear in the list of Switches. It should display as a switch. If the Controller/Gateway shows the addition failed, repeat Steps 1-3.

_**NOTE**: If you have trouble adding the WO15EMZ5-1 to a group it may be that the Home ID and Node ID were not cleared from it after testing. You must fi rst “RESET UNIT” to remove it from the network. Although adding it to a group includes it in the network, removing it from a group does not remove it from the network. If removed from a group, it functions as a repeater (only). “RESET UNIT” removes it completely from the network_

### Exclusion Information

The WO15EMZ5-1 can be removed from the network by the Controller/Gateway. Refer to the Controller operating instructions for details.

  1. Set the Controller into Removal Mode and follow its instruction to delete the WO15EMZ5-1 from the Controller.
  2. Remove the switch by tapping the button on the face of the outlet 2 times. The LED will begin blinking slowly for 10 seconds indicating that it has been removed.
  3. You should see an indication on your Controller that the “device was removed” from the network.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the WO15EMZ5-1 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Switch | switch_binary | switch_binary | Switch | Switch | 
| Scene Number | scene_number | scene_number |  | Number | 
| Electric meter (kWh) | meter_kwh | meter_kwh | Energy | Number | 
| Electric meter (watts) | meter_watts | meter_watts | Energy | Number | 

### Switch
Switch the power on and off.

The ```switch_binary``` channel is of type ```switch_binary``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Switch``` category.

### Scene Number
Triggers when a scene button is pressed.

The ```scene_number``` channel is of type ```scene_number``` and supports the ```Number``` item.

### Electric meter (kWh)
Indicates the energy consumption (kWh).

The ```meter_kwh``` channel is of type ```meter_kwh``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Electric meter (watts)
Indicates the instantaneous power consumption.

The ```meter_watts``` channel is of type ```meter_watts``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.



## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 2 configuration parameters available in the WO15EMZ5-1.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 3 | Night Light | LED mode for attached load |
| 13 | Energy Monitoring | Minutes |
|  | Switch All Mode | Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands |

### Parameter 3: Night Light

LED mode for attached load
By default, the LED on the WO15EMZ5-1 will turn OFF when the load attached is turned ON. To make the LED turn ON when the load attached is turned ON, set Parameter 3 to a value of 1.
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Show opposite of powered state |
| 1 | Show powered state |
| 2 | On |
| 3 | Off |
| 4 | Blink on RF transmission |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Show opposite of powered state).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 13: Energy Monitoring

Minutes
WO15EMZ5-1 reports the total accumulated Kilowatt Hours (kWh) and the instantaneous Watts being consumed by the load.

Valid values are 0 - 255, with 0 disabling automatic reporting, and 1 - 255 being the interval in minutes for the automatic reporting interval.

Configuration Parameter 13 configures the rate at which the energy readings are reported. If the maximum kWh value that can be reported is reached (21,474 kWh), then it will remain at the maximum level until reset to 0.

The Watts reading provides the immediate reading of the power being consumed by the load. The Watts reading takes several seconds to settle so wait a few seconds before reading the energy value when the state of the switch (on / off) has changed.

To reset, the total accumulated kWh used by the WO15EMZ5-1 the Z-Wave controller needs to send a reset command at the request of the user. It will also be reset if the WO15EMZ5-1 is excluded from the Z-Wave network.
The following option values may be configured, in addition to values in the range 0 to 255 -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Disabled |
| 6 | Default |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```6``` (Default).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_13_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Switch All Mode

Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands.

The following option values may be configured -:
| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Exclude from All On and All Off groups |
| 1 | Include in All On group |
| 2 | Include in All Off group |
| 255 | Include in All On and All Off groups |

This parameter has the configuration ID ```switchall_mode``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The WO15EMZ5-1 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Lifeline Association
The WO15EMZ5-1 supports one Group with five Nodes for lifeline communication. Group 1 must be assigned the Node ID of the Controller to which unsolicited notifications from the WO15EMZ5-1 will be sent. The Z-Wave Controller should set this Association automatically after inclusion. You can associate up to five Z-Wave devices to Group 1.

For instructions on how to “set Lifeline Association” please refer to your wireless Controller instructions.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.
