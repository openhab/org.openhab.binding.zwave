The PD300EMZ5-1 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

The GoControl PD300EMZ5-1 Plug-in Lamp Module is designed to provide Z-Wave control to a connected dimmable lamp. The PD300EMZ5-1 module is plugged into any standard grounded AC wall outlet, and the lamp is then plugged into the module. Once connected, the lamp can be dimmed or turned on or off remotely via the Z-Wave controller. The module contains two power receptacles - one controlled, and one pass-through (powered at all times).

This Plug-in Lamp Module integrates with other Nortek Security & Control Z-Wave enabled products, and can also act as a wireless repeater to ensure that commands intended for another device in the network are received (useful when a device would otherwise be out of radio range).

#### Auto-Sense

Unique to Nortek Security & Control, the Auto-Sense feature allows for local lamp activation independent of the Z-Wave controller status. With AutoSense, one can simply switch the connected lamp's manual switch off, then on, and AutoSense will instruct the PD300EMZ5-1 to turn the lamp on.

#### Specifications

  * Signal (Frequency): 908.42 MHz
  * Maximum Load:  
    Incandescent: 300W maximum, 120 VAC
  * Range: Up to 100 feet line of sight between the wireless controller and/or the closest Z-Wave device
  * Network wide inclusion
  * One controlled and one pass-through outlet
  * Security beaming

### Inclusion Information

Refer to your Controller operating instructions to add this switch under the command of the Wireless Controller.

  1. With your Controller in Discovery or Add Mode, tap the button on the face of the outlet. The LED will blink slowly when in ADD Mode.
  2. You should see an indication on your Controller that the "device was added" to the network and the LED will stop blinking.
  3. The device will appear in the list of Switches. It should display as a switch.  
    If the Controller/Gateway shows the addition failed, repeat Steps 1-3.

_NOTE_: If you have trouble adding the PD300EMZ5-1 to a group it may be that the Home ID and Node ID were not cleared from it after testing. You must first "RESET UNIT" to remove it from the network. Although adding it to a group includes it in the network, removing it from a group does not remove it from the network. If removed from a group, it functions as a repeater (only). "RESET UNIT" removes it completely from the network.

### Exclusion Information

**To Reset Unit (If Required):**  
In the event that your primary Controller is lost or otherwise inoperable, to reset the PD300EMZ5-1 and clear all network information, follow these steps:

  1. Tap the button on the face of the outlet five (5) times.
  2. Press and hold the button for 15 seconds. The LED will increasingly blink faster to indicate that a Reset is taking place.

**Removing from a network:**  
The PD300EMZ5-1 can be removed from the network by the Controller / Gateway. Refer to the Controller operating instructions for details.

  1. Set the Controller into Removal Mode and follow its instruction to delete the PD300EMZ5-1 from the Controller.
  2. Remove the switch by tapping the button on the face of the outlet 2 times. The LED will begin blinking slowly for 10 seconds indicating that it has been removed.
  3. You should see an indication on your Controller that the "device was removed" from the network.

### Wakeup Information

The PD300EMZ5-1 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The PD300EMZ5-1 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Lifeline

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.
