# HKZW-SO05 Smart Plug

This describes the Z-Wave device *HKZW-SO05*, manufactured by *Hank* with the thing type UID of ```hank_so05_00_000```. 

Smart Plug  


## Overview 

Smart plug is a Z-Wave Switch plugin module specifically used to enable Z-Wave command and control (on/off) of any plug-in tool. It can report wattage consumption or kWh energy usage. Smart Plug is also a security Z-Wave device and supports the Over The Air (OTA) feature for the product's firmware upgrade.

HKZW-SO05 is a Smart Plug based on Z-Wave plus specification

The features list:

1) Supports 1xAC output and 2xUSB outputs;

2) AC output switch on/off by manual or Z-Wave command;

3) RGB LED indicates the Z-Wave network range;

4) RGB LED indicates the load power;

5) Z-Wave plus compatible (500 serials product);

6) supporting power meter;

7) supporting repeater role;

Supporting firmware OTA;

  


### Inclusion Information 

**Automatic Z-Wave network inclusion:**

1) Set the Z-Wave network main controller into inclusion mode.

2) Insert the Plug into a socket.

3) Auto-inclusion will be activated, i.e. Plug automatically starts looking for Z-Wave network controller. Auto-inclusion activation is signaled by a single, RGB LED indicator blink fast in blue.

4) Smart Plug should be recognized and automatically included into the Z-Wave network.

**Manual Z-Wave network inclusion:**

1) Connect the power supply.

2) Set the Z-Wave network main controller into inclusion mode.

3) Triple click the Z-button, RGB LED indicator should blink fast in blue.

4) Smart Plug should be recognized and included into the Z-Wave network.

**Included as a secure device:**

1) Connect the power supply.

2) Set the Z-Wave network main controller into secure inclusion mode.

3) Press and hold the Z-button for more than 3 seconds, RGB LED indicator should blink fast in green.

4) Smart Plug should be recognized and included into the Z-Wave security network.

  


### Exclusion Information 

**To remove Smart Plug from the Z-Wave network:**

1) Insert the plug into a socket.

2) Set the Z-Wave network main controller into exclusion mode.

3) Triple click the Z-button.

4) RGB LED indicator will blink orange till the removing process is completed, then the indicator will keep orange for 3 seconds.
