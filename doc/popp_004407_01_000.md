This describes the Z-Wave device *004407*, manufactured by *Popp &amp; Co* with the thing type UID of ```popp_004407_01_000```. 

CO Detector  


## Overview 

This product combines a certified carbon monoxide detector with a plug-in Z-Wave module to form a wirelessly reporting carbon monoxide sensor. The carbon monoxide detector is certified according to EN 50270:1999, EN 60335-1:1994 as well as EN 50291:2001 and satisfies all contemporary legal requirements.

There is no defined level of carbon monoxide that will result in an alarm. The danger of CO is a result of the total level of CO in the air plus the duration of exposure. A Z-Wave alarm will be sent out when one of the following conditions were met:

 *  CO level above 43 ppm for a duration of 60 minutes
 *  CO level above 80 ppm for a duration of 10 minutes
 *  CO level above 150 ppm for a duration of 2 minutes

  


### Inclusion Information 

Pressing the Z-Wave button for one second includes the device. If the button is pressed for at least 2 seconds, the inclusion will be done without the Security Command Class.

  


### Exclusion Information 

A single click on the Z-Wave button will exclude the device.

  


### Wakeup Information 

Wakeup is done by single push of the Z-Wave button
