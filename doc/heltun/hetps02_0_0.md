The HE-TPS02 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

HELTUN HE-TPS02 Advanced Programmable Touch Panel Switch brings "Impossibly Smart" capabilities to your home lighting, electric outlets, or motorized blinds, door locks, gates, and valves. It replaces an existing in-wall switch and brings over-the-Internet monitoring, control, and advanced programmability. Device is "Impossibly Thin" on the wall yet packed with features to provide the ultimate in control and convenience.

### Inclusion Information

To add the HE-TPS02 to an existing Z-Wave network (i.e. “inclusion”), do the following:

  1. Start the Inclusion Mode from the gateway/controller.
  2. To start the inclusion process on the HE-TPS02, simultaneously press the two upper hidden touch buttons (see Figure 8) and hold them for three seconds.
  3. All buttons will then sequentially blink ‘blue-red’.
  4. If the inclusion has been successful, all buttons will turn blue for three seconds.
  5. If the inclusion was not successful, all buttons will turn red for three seconds. In that case repeat the inclusion process.

### Exclusion Information

To remove the HE-TPS02 from a Z-Wave network (i.e. “Exclusion”), do the following:

  1. Start the Exclusion Mode from the gateway/controller.
  2. To start the exclusion process on the HE-TPS02, simultaneously press the two upper hidden touch buttons (see Figure 8) and hold them for three seconds.
  3. All buttons will sequentially blink blue-red.
  4. If the exclusion has been successful, all buttons will turn red for three seconds.
  5. If the exclusion was not successful, all buttons will turn blue for three seconds. In that case repeat the exclusion process.

Note: If the HE-TPS02 has previously been part of a Z-Wave network and not Excluded since, Inclusion is not possible without rst performing an Exclusion or Factory Reset procedure.
