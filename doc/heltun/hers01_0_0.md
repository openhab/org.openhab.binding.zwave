# HE-RS01 Five-channel relay
This describes the Z-Wave device *HE-RS01*, manufactured by *Heltun* with the thing type UID of ```heltun_hers01_00_000```.

The device is in the category of *Wall Switch*, defining Any device attached to the wall that controls a binary status of something, for ex. a light switch.

The HE-RS01 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

The Relay Switch quinto with roller shutter control brings incredible capabilities to any connected device. It makes light switches ‘smart’ with full remote monitoring, control, and advanced programmability. This brings the convenience of smartphone app control and automation to ‘dumb’ devices such as multi-gang light switches, electronic door locks, motorized gates, blinds, windows, and valves. At 26mm in depth, the Relay Switch quinto is also ‘impossibly small’, fitting into any rectangular, round or square electrical junction box, even behind attached devices.  


For example, you can control up to...

  *  Five ON/OFF devices
  * Three ON/OFF devices, and one, two-direction motor
  * One ON/OFF device, and two, two-direction motors

It is designed to fit inside standard round, square, or rectangular electrical junction boxes installed behind an existing in-wall switch or inside a circuit breaker panel. Relay Switch Quinto enables On/Off controls of lights, dimmers, blinds, doors, gates, valves, and motors either manually by a direct-connected switch, or remotely through a Z-WaveTM network. Thanks to the HE-RS01 five-channel relays it can manage up to five On/Off devices, or three On/Off devices and one two-direction motors, or one On/Off device and two two-direction motors. It has two independent inputs for relay channels which allow it to control systems with different power sources or to use relay outputs as dry contacts. Each relay can be loaded up to five amps and uses the HELTUN Advanced Zero-Cross Technology to increase the life of the device and connected system.

### Inclusion Information

  1. Ensure the HE-RS01 is Powered On and the LED indicator blinks red slowly (i.e. it is excluded)
  2. Start the Inclusion mode from the gateway/controller
  3. To start the inclusion process on the HE-RS01, double-press the service button on the device (with no more than a one-second interval between presses).
  4. The LED indicator will blink green quickly.
  5. If the inclusion has been successful, the LED indicator will turn green for three seconds then continue slowly blinking green continuously while the HE-RS01 is Powered On.
  6. If the inclusion was not successful, the LED indicator will turn red for three seconds then continue slowly blinking red continuously while Powered On. In that case repeat the inclusion process (steps 2-5) above.

### Exclusion Information

  1. 1. Ensure the HE-RS01 is Powered On and the LED indicator is slowly blinking green (i.e. it is included in a Z-Wave network).
  2. Start the Exclusion mode from the gateway/controller.
  3. To start the exclusion process on the HE-RS01, double-press the service button on the device (with no more than a one-second interval between presses).
  4. The LED indicator will blink red quickly.
  5. If the inclusion has been successful, the LED indicator will turn red for three seconds then continue blinking red slowly continuously while the HE-RS01 is Powered On.
  6. If the inclusion was not successful, the LED indicator will turn green for three seconds then continue slow blink green all the time the device is Powered On. In that case repeat the exclusion process (steps 2-5) above.

≡ Note: If the HE-RS01 has previously been part of a Z-Wave network and has not been Excluded since (the LED indicator blinks green slowly), inclusion is not possible without first performing an Exclusion or Factory Reset procedure.

### General Usage Information

Use the N and L contacts to power the device, you can either use 85-265VAC or 24-48VDC. The relay has five output channels. Whatever you feed into IN4-5 (AC or DC within the ranges above) will come out of OUT4-5 when you toggle them on. Whatever you feed into IN1-3 will come out of OUT1-3 when you toggle one of those on. There are also two triple-contact slots where you can connect mechanical switches.

**Factory Reset procedure:**

To reset the HE-RS01 to factory defaults, press and hold the service button for six seconds. If successful, the LED indicator will blink white slowly for two seconds, then the device will reboot. This factory reset procedure will change all parameters to the original factory default values and will also exclude the device from any associated Z-Wave network.

≡ Note: Please use Factory Reset only when the primary network controller is missing or otherwise inoperable.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The HE-RS01 supports 16 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Reports full state of the device and is used to communicate with the Z-Wave gateway.
≡ Note: It is not recommended to modify this group.

≡ Note: For correct operating in Fibaro gateways, the Single Channel Association should be removed from the device LifeLine (EndPoint 0 Group 1).

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: External Input S1 Basic Set

It is assigned to the state of S1 input and will be triggered when the button is pressed on the switch connected to input S1. Is used to send Basic Set ON (value 255) and Basic Set OFF (value 0) commands to the associated devices.

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: External Input S1 Multilevel Set

It is assigned to the state of S1 input. It sends MULTILEVEL SWITCH command class frame when the button is held on the switch connected to input S1. Is used to send UP/DOWN command to the associated devices.

Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 4: External Input S2 Basic Set

It is assigned to the state of S2 input and will be triggered when the button is pressed on the switch connected to input S2. Is used to send Basic Set ON (value 255) and Basic Set OFF (value 0) commands to the associated devices.

Association group 4 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 5: External Input S2 Multilevel Set

It is assigned to the state of S2 input. It sends MULTILEVEL SWITCH command class frame when the button is held on the switch connected to input S2. Is used to send UP/DOWN command to the associated devices.

Association group 5 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 6: External Input S3 Basic Set

It is assigned to the state of S3 input and will be triggered when the button is pressed on the switch connected to input S3. Is used to send Basic Set ON (value 255) and Basic Set OFF (value 0) commands to the associated devices.

Association group 6 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 7: External Input S3 Multilevel Set

It is assigned to the state of S3 input. It sends MULTILEVEL SWITCH command class frame when the button is held on the switch connected to input S3. Is used to send UP/DOWN command to the associated devices.
