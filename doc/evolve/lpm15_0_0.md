The LPM-15 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

The Evolve Plug-in Appliance Module is a component of the Evolve lighting control system and is fully scene capable. The Appliance Module is plugged into any standard grounded AC wall outlet, and the appliance or other device is then plugged into the module. Once connected, the appliance/device can be easily turned ON or OFF remotely via the Z-Wave network.

This device is compatible with Z-Wave security systems and can handle a maximum of the following loads:

  * Incandescent – 600W, 120 VAC
  * Resistive – 15 amps (1800 watts), 120 VAC
  * Motor – ½ H.P., 120 VAC

This Plug-in Appliance Module is designed to work with other Evolve enabled devices. Evolve nodes of other types can be included in the network and will also act as repeaters to increase the range of the network.

As part of a Z-Wave network, the LPM-15 will also act as a wireless repeater to ensure that commands intended for another device in the network are received. This is useful when the device would otherwise be out of the radio range of the wireless controller.
