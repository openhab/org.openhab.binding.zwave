## Overview

The system consists of LCD Keypads, Lighting devices, Drape Relay controllers and Thermostats (All communicating over a Z-Wave network). Scenes will be the primary mechanism for activating various modes in the room. A provisioning tool will be used to do the initial node assignment and to then configure the various scenes using a predefined room template.

The LCD Keypads will act as a Scene Controller. Upon the pressing of a button, a Scene Activate, BasicSet or other Command will be sent out to the nodes predefined in a group’s association list.

The Keypads scenes are configured using the Scene Controller Configuration command class. The Group ID will match the association group ID used when the Scene Activation Command Class is sent to the nodes in the group.

### Inclusion Information

1. Set your primary controller to Include mode, to add the keypad as a node on your network (see your controller’s user manual for detailed instructions).

2. If the EVLCDx Keypad is not installed (as shown on the screen when the keypad first powers up), Press the upper-leftmost keypad button when the main screen is displayed. The controller will indicate the keypad has been included into the network.

Your controller will indicate the keypad was successfully added to its network (see your controller’s user manual for details). Also you can check if the keypad was successfully added to the network by checking the ZHID (Home ID) and ZNID (Node ID) located in the Z-Wave Info screen. The Z-Wave Info screen is accessible by holding down the top keypad button while the keypad is powering up, releasing when the maintenance screen appears. Inclusion and exclusion are always done at normal transmit power mode.

### Exclusion Information
