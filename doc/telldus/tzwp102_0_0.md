The TZWP-102 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

Telldus Z-Wave Plug-in Switch Mini, small size, clean design with energy metering and overcurrent protection. With its small size and clean design, it fits into your home interior design very well also it is possible to use two devices side by side in most electrical outlets. LED indicator can be turned off to not disturb in dark rooms. Control lighting, chargers and other electronic equipment up to 2300 W (resistive load).

With energy consumption measuring you don’t only see the actual consumption, it can also help to find out if your connected device is ok or not or turn off the mobile charger when the mobile phone is fully charged for safe operation.

The device acts as a repeater for the Z-Wave network. 

### Inclusion Information

**Automatically add device to network**

When the device is inserted into an electrical outlet it’s in automatic add mode (Network Wide Inclusion, NWI). This means that the device is added automatically when the Z-Wave controller enters add mode.

**Manually add device to network**

Start the add mode on the Z-Wave controller. Press the button on the device three times fast. The device will now be added into the Z-Wave network.

### Exclusion Information

Start the exclusion mode on the Z-Wave controller. Press the button on the device three times fast. The device will now be removed from the Z-Wave network.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The TZWP-102 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Lifeline

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.
