The UMV3-BTZ supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

## Overview

The Universal Model V3 supports: - S0/S2 Z-Wave Security - Can operate 3 outputs. - Outputs can be delayed. - Bluetooth Smart

The UMV3 can be set to factory settings by pushing the switch 10 times. Please use this procedure only when the primary controller is missing or otherwise inoperable.

### Inclusion Information

To add or include the UMV3 into a Z-Wave network 1. Set the controller in inclusion mode 2. Push the switch once. 3. Wait 5 seconds.

### Exclusion Information

To remove or exclude the UMV3 into a Z-Wave network 1. Set the controller in exclusion mode 2. Push the switch once. 3. Wait 5 seconds.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the UMV3-BTZ -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Door Lock | lock_door | lock_door | Door | Switch | 
| Entry Alarm | alarm_entry | alarm_entry | Door | Switch | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | system.battery_level | Battery | Number |

### Door Lock
Lock and unlock the door.

The ```lock_door``` channel is of type ```lock_door``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Door``` category.
The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| ON | Locked |
| OFF | Unlocked |

### Entry Alarm
Indicates if the entry alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_entry``` channel is of type ```alarm_entry``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Door``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| ON | Open |
| OFF | Closed |

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The UMV3-BTZ supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 1 node.
