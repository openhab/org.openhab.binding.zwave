The Danalock V3-BTZE supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

## Overview

Danalock supports:

  * S0/S2 Z-Wave Security
  * Bluetooth Smart
  * Twist Assist
  * Auto Lock
  * Hold And Release
  * Back To Back 

### Inclusion Information

To add or include the Danalock into a Z-Wave network

  1. Pair the lock with bluetooth first
  2. Set the controller in inclusion mode

  3. Push the switch once.

  4. Wait 5 seconds. 

### Exclusion Information

To remove or exclude the Danalock into a Z-Wave network

  1. Delete the lock within the app (bluetooth)
  2. Set the controller in exclusion mode

  3. Push the switch once.

  4. Wait 5 seconds. 

### General Usage Information

Additional hints:

**Inclusion**: Do **not** include the lock to a Z-Wave network before it has been paired through bluetooth. Otherwise the lock is blocked and you are not able to pair through bluetooth. If you are not able to pair through the app then there is still z-wave information that has not been erased. A factory reset does not delete this Z-Wave information. You must exclude.

**Exclusion**: Delete the lock from the app before you exclude. Otherwise it won’t work. Exclusion is successful when the green light stops lightning immediately. If you use the Aeotec Z-Stick Gen5 it is easier to exclude with the USB stick detached. Inclusion of course with the stick attached to the PC. You can use any kind of controller to exclude - no matter with which controller it has been paired before.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The Danalock V3-BTZE supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

  * Device Reset Locally: triggered upon reset.
  * Battery/notification: triggered upon low battery.
  * Door Lock operation report: triggered upon a change in door lock
