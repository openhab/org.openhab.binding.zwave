Value 1 (MSB) see Overview  


##### Overview 

scroll to bottom for examples.

bits 7 and 6 for colour transition style

bits 5 and 4 are reserved (always 0)

bits 3,2,1,0 are colour display

colour display options are:

0 single colour mode

1 Rainbow Mode(red, orange, yellow, green, cyan, blue, violet,pinkish)

2 Multi Colour Mode(colours cycle between selected colours)

3 Random mode

15 Inactive (keep current mode)

Single colour mode: The Bulb is solid with one colour in this mode. If you want to change its current  
colour, you need to turn the Bulb off and on 2 times via wall switch within 1 second, the Bulb will enter  
into colour change status. During this time, turning the wall switch off when your desired colour appears,  
will be used as the colour of the bulb when it is on.  
→  
Rainbow mode: The Bulb has 8 colours to display and will change through a range of colors (Red  
Orange Yellow Green Cyan Blue Violet pinkish).  
Multi-colour mode: The Bulb can change between multiple colours according to the colour index which  
is configurable through configuration parameter 38, see the configuration table of parameter 38 below.

Random mode: The Bulb’s colour will be displayed randomly.

Colour Transition Style (2 bits)

0 Smooth transitions

1 Fast/Direct transition

2 Fade out/Fade in

3 Inactive (keep current configuration)

**examples:**

Default is 00 single color mode with smooth color transitions. 

Set to 01 for rainbow mode with smooth color transitions
