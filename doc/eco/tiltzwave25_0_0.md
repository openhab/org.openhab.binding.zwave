The TILT-ZWAVE2.5-ECO supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The TILT-ZWAVE2.5-ECO does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

  * Z-Wave PlusTM enabled device which transmits when a garage door is opened or closed
  * Uses a tilt sensor to detect the angle of a door and transmits open/closed status
  * Reports tamper condition if cover is removedÂ 

### Inclusion Information

1. Start by placing the controller into inclusion mode.

2. Activate inclusion mode for the sensor by inserting the battery. When the inclusion process is complete the red LED will turn on for approximately 10 seconds and then it will go out. If the LED continues to flash, repeat the inclusion process.

3. Test the garage door sensor before mounting it. Hold the sensor in your hand. Flip the sensor upside-down and watch the LED while doing so. The LED will flash each time the position of the sensor is changed. If your Z- Wave network has a software interface you may verify that the messages from the sensor are being received each time the sensor is flipped.

If you need to repeat the inclusion process, repeat STEP ONE above, then for STEP TWO you will need to simply remove the cover of the sensor, remove the battery for 5 seconds, reinsert the battery, and replace the sensor cover. This will re-enter the sensor in inclusion mode.

### Exclusion Information

Exclusion mode on the sensor is activated on the sensor by the exact same procedure as inclusion.

### Wakeup Information

The TILT-ZWAVE2.5-ECO does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


To save power, this sensor sleeps most of the time and is therefore not awake to receive messages from a gateway for testing. Removing the top case from the sensor will put in device into a tampered mode in which the sensor will stay awake and able to receive messages. Most of the time an end user would not do this, but if the sensor needs to be configured after inclusion, an end user can follow the instructions below for sending Wake-Up notifications.

The sensor will wake up every so often and when the case is closed, it will send a Wake-Up Notification to allow the life line master node controller that the sensor is now available for any queued messages that the controller may have for the sensor. **The time between Wake-Up Notifications can be configured with the Wake-Up Notification command class to be between 1 hour and 1 week with interval steps of 200 seconds.**

## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 2 configuration parameters available in the TILT-ZWAVE2.5-ECO.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Basic Sets for Association Group 2 | Send or not send Basic Set commands |
| 2 | Send Reports | Send Reports |
|  | Wakeup Interval | Sets the interval at which the device will accept commands from the controller |
|  | Wakeup Node | Sets the node ID of the device to receive the wakeup notifications |

### Parameter 1: Basic Sets for Association Group 2

Send or not send Basic Set commands
Send or not send Basic Set commands of 0x00 to nodes in Association group 2 turning the devices off when the sensor is in a restored state i.e. the door is closed
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Do Not Send Basic Sets |
| 255 | Send Basic Sets |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Do Not Send Basic Sets).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Send Reports

Send Reports
Send or not to send Sensor Binary Report commands to Association Group 1 when the sensor is faulted and restored
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Send Sensor Binary and Notification Reports |
| 255 | Send Only Notification Reports |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Send Sensor Binary and Notification Reports).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The TILT-ZWAVE2.5-ECO supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Sends low-battery, tamper, open/close, and sensor binary reports
Group one is a lifeline group who will receive unsolicited messages relating to door/window open/close notifications (because there is no association group for tilt switches), case tampering notifications, low-battery notifications, and sensor binary reports.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Basic Set

Sends ON/OFF commands to other devices based on state
Group 2 is intended for devices that are to be controlled i.e. turned on or off (on only by default) with a Basic Set

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.
