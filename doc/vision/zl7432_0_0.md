### Inclusion Information

For “Inclusion” in (adding to) a network: Put the Z-Wave™ Interface Controller into “inclusion” mode, and following its instruction to add the ZL 7432 to your controller. To get in the “inclusion” mode, the distance between module and controller is suggested to be in one meter. Turn on and turn off the wall switch that connects with ZL 7432 module 4 times to be included. (or press the Program SW 4 times within 2 seconds to be included)

### Exclusion Information

For “Exclusion” from (removing from) a network: Put the Z-Wave™ Interface Controller into “exclusion” mode, and following its instruction to delete the ZL 7432 from your controller. Turn on and turn off the wall switch that connects with ZL 7432 module 4 times to be excluded. (or press the Program SW 4 times within 2 seconds to be excluded)
