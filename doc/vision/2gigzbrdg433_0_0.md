## Overview

<p&gtThis GoControl (formerly 2GIG) Plug-in Lamp Module is integrates with other Z-Wave products. It can also act as a wireless repeater to ensure that commands intended for another device in the network are received (useful when a device would otherwise be out of radio range).</p&gt <ul&gt<li&gtOne-controlled outlet for control and dimming of lamps (Z-Wave hub required)</li&gt <li&gtWorks with many Z-Wave controllers, including SmartThings, WINK, FIBARO Home Center, Vera, and many more!</li&gt <li&gtFor indoor use only</li&gt <li&gtMay be packaged referencing 2GIG Energy Bridge; device sold as a Z-Wave lamp dimmer only</li&gt </ul&gt<p&gt<strong&gtSPECIFICATIONS</strong&gt</p&gt <ul&gt<li&gtSignal (Frequency): 908.42 MHz</li&gt <li&gtMaximum Load (Incandescent): 300W maximum, 120 VAC</li&gt <li&gtRange: Up to 100 feet between the wireless controller and/or the closest Z-Wave device</li&gt <li&gt120 VAC, 60 H</li&gt </ul&gt

### Inclusion Information

<p&gtWhen the device is unpaired, press the button on the front till the relay inside clicks to put it into Zwave pairing mode.</p&gt

### Exclusion Information

<p&gtAt this time I have no idea how to exclude this device, If I figure it out I will update this.</p&gt

### General Usage Information

<p&gtWorks as a plug in lamp dimmerÂ for a 2 wire lamp.</p&gt <p&gtRequires to plugged into a grounded outlet.</p&gt <p&gtAlso acts as a Zwave to 433Mhz bridge for connection to various energy monitoring devices</p&gt <p&gtSold as 2GIG, Vision Security, Norteck Security, and Go Control as far as I can see.</p&gt <p&gtSeems to be intended for installers as finding information on it's use with Zwave is quite difficult.</p&gt

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Dimmer | switch_dimmer | switch_dimmer | DimmableLight | Dimmer | 
| Electric meter (kWh) | meter_kwh | meter_kwh | Energy | Number | 
| Electric meter (watts) | meter_watts | meter_watts | Energy | Number | 

### Dimmer
The brightness channel allows to control the brightness of a light.
            It is also possible to switch the light on and off.

The ```switch_dimmer``` channel is of type ```switch_dimmer``` and supports the ```Dimmer``` item and is in the ```DimmableLight``` category.

### Electric meter (kWh)
Indicates the energy consumption (kWh).

The ```meter_kwh``` channel is of type ```meter_kwh``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Electric meter (watts)
Indicates the instantaneous power consumption.

The ```meter_watts``` channel is of type ```meter_watts``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.



## Device Configuration

The device has no configuration parameters defined.

## Association Groups
