The ZP3102 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The ZP3102 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

The ZP3102 is a Z-Wave enabled motion detector and temperature sensor. The motion detector has 120 degrees of horizontal visibility and 60 degrees of vertical visibility. The temperature sensor that is built in to the ZP3102 is capable of reporting in both Celsius and Fahrenheit scales, and may be queried for the temperature and it will report it automatically when it detects changes. The sensor is battery operated and includes the ability to report the battery level and will transmit an alert signal if the battery assumes a critically low level. The ZP3102 is future-proofed by also supporting the ability to have its firmware updated over the Z-Wave network.

### Inclusion Information

Press the program switch of ZP3102 once. The LED on the ZP3102 should stop flashing, if not, please try again.

### Exclusion Information

Press the program switch of ZP3102 once to be excluded. The LED on the ZP3102 should start to flash

### Wakeup Information

The ZP3102 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


Note: ”**Awake**” mode: it is to leave the “Sleep” mode by removing the cover of ZP3102, to allow the Z-Wave TM Interface Controller to do “Association”.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the ZP3102 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Binary Sensor | sensor_binary | sensor_binary |  | Switch | 
| Sensor (temperature) | sensor_temperature | sensor_temperature | Temperature | Number:Temperature | 
| Alarm (burglar) | alarm_burglar | alarm_burglar | Door | Switch | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | system.battery_level | Battery | Number |

### Binary Sensor
Indicates if a sensor has triggered.

The ```sensor_binary``` channel is of type ```sensor_binary``` and supports the ```Switch``` item. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| ON | Triggered |
| OFF | Untriggered |

### Sensor (temperature)
Indicates the current temperature.

The ```sensor_temperature``` channel is of type ```sensor_temperature``` and supports the ```Number:Temperature``` item and is in the ```Temperature``` category.

### Alarm (burglar)
Indicates if the burglar alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_burglar``` channel is of type ```alarm_burglar``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Door``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.


## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 3 configuration parameters available in the ZP3102.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | On time in minutes | Delay before sending OFF |
| 2 | Celsius / Fahrenheit | 0 = Celsius, 1 = Fahrenheit |
| 3 | Infrared sensor sensitivity adjustment | 1 is most sensitive, 7 is least |
|  | Wakeup Interval | Sets the interval at which the device will accept commands from the controller |
|  | Wakeup Node | Sets the node ID of the device to receive the wakeup notifications |

### Parameter 1: On time in minutes

Delay before sending OFF

Values in the range 1 to 255 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```3```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Celsius / Fahrenheit

0 = Celsius, 1 = Fahrenheit

The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Celsius |
| 1 | Fahrenheit |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Celsius).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: Infrared sensor sensitivity adjustment

1 is most sensitive, 7 is least
(Parameter 3) Infrared sensor sensitivity adjustment, 7 levels sensitivity, 1 = most  
sensitive, 7 = most insensitive, default values= 4
Values in the range 1 to 7 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```4```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZP3102 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Control Command


Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.
