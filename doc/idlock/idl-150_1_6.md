The ID-150 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

## Overview

The ID Lock Z-wave module is a security enabled Z-wave Plus product that is able to use encrypted Z-wave Plus messages in order to communicate to other Z-wave Plus products enabled security.

The module is proprietary for the ID Lock 150. The ID Lock Z-wave module must be used in conjunction with a Security Enabled Z-wave Controller in order to fully utilize their full capability.

The ID Lock Z-wave module can be included and operated in any Z-wave network containing certified other Z-wave products regardless of manufacturer. The ID Lock Z-wave module does not support the Basic Set Command Class.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ID-150 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.
