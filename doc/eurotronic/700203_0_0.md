The 700203 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The 700203 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

The Eurotronic Door/Window Contact Z-Wave Plus is a battery powered wireless binary sensor for detecting 

the door or window open/closed position. The device uses an optical sensor for the status detection.

### Inclusion Information

Start the inclusion mode of your primary Z-Wave controller . 

Press the button within the housing of your Door/Window Contact three times in quick succession in order to activate the inclusion mode. While the inclusion mode is active, the green LED is blinking. The joining attempt takes approx. 30 seconds.

If the inclusion was successful, the green LED lights up for 5 seconds. Otherwise, the red LED light up for 5 seconds to indicate failure.

### Exclusion Information

Start the exclusion mode of your primary Z-Wave controller. 

Press the button within the housing of your Door/Window Contact three times in quick succession in order to activate the exclusion mode. During the attempt to leave the network, the green LED is blinking.

If the exclusion was successful, the green LED light up for 5 seconds. Otherwise, the red LED lights up for 5 seconds to indicate failure.

### Wakeup Information

The 700203 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


Press the button within the housing of your Door/Window Contact three times in quick succession in order to wake up the device (necessary about 3 to 10 times every 4-5 seconds when first identifying the device)

### General Usage Information



## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the 700203 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Door Sensor | sensor_door | sensor_door | Door | Contact | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | system.battery_level | Battery | Number |

### Door Sensor
Door/Window position

0x16: Door/Window opened

0x17: Door/Window closed

Indicates if the door/window is open or closed.

The ```sensor_door``` channel is of type ```sensor_door``` and supports the ```Contact``` item and is in the ```Door``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Contact``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OPEN | Open |
| CLOSED | Closed |

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.


## Device Configuration

The device has no configuration parameters defined.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The 700203 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Lifeline to Z Wave Controller (battery information, notification report, device reset notification)

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: OnOff

Used for directly turning other devices on or off, depending of sensor state
With this association, the sensor could for example close a radiator valve when a window is opened, without the need of an extra z-wave controller. (BASIC_SET)

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.
