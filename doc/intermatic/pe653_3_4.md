The PE653 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

<p&gtA wireless electronic controller for pool or spa automation. Retrofit existing mechanical timers or install with new construction. Integrates with home automation software that utilizes Z-Wave wireless technology.</p&gt <p&gtThe unit itself is the PE653, which is a control box that directly controls the pump(s) and heater as well as connects to a temperature probe.</p&gt <p&gtThe unit also typically comes with a hand held wireless remote (the PE953). In standard mode, this controller is a primary controller that only has the PE653 in a local Z-Wave network. To use this controller in another z-wave network, the PE653 is included in that network and then the PE953 is set as a secondary controller.</p&gt <p&gtThis unit has support for 1 and 2 speed pumps as well as variable speed pumps. </p&gt

### Inclusion Information

<p&gtIncluding the PE653 alone is very easy. Put your controller into include mode and the click the include button on the PE 653. </p&gt <p&gtWhen you want to continue to use the PE953 as a secondary controller, the process is more involved. You must follow these steps exactly. Also, these steps are for version 3.4 of the firmware only. 3.1-3.3 can still be included (although the controller locks up on Step 9 and must have the batteries pulled to reset), but the command classes are not the same and won't work with this entry.</p&gt <p&gt1. 953 choose Reset Device {clears the 653}</p&gt <p&gt2. 653 push Include button {wipes programming, Include light starts blinking}</p&gt <p&gt3. 953 choose Reset Controller, choose ‘reset net & config’</p&gt <p&gt4. Put your master ZWave controller into include mode </p&gt <p&gt5. 653 push Include button</p&gt <p&gt6. App should pair and prompt to select name, handler, app, etc</p&gt <p&gt7. 953 choose Controller Copy {another non-intuitive step, this adds the remote to the master Zwave controller}</p&gt <p&gt8. 953 choose Receive Net Only</p&gt <p&gt9. 953 should report ‘Successful’</p&gt <p&gt10.    Put your master zWave controller back into operating mode. For me, this meant plugging it back into openhab and restarting. Do not leave your controller in include mode for the next step, or it won't include</p&gt <p&gt10. 953 choose Include device</p&gt <p&gt11. 653 push Include button {one more time!}</p&gt <p&gt12. 953 should report ‘successful’</p&gt <p&gtPE653 should not show up in Inbox. </p&gt <p&gtAlso, please note that the PE653 will reboot a few times while OpenHab discovers it. This is normal and will stop after a few reboots.</p&gt

### Exclusion Information

<p&gtExcluding the PE653 alone is very easy. Put a controller into exclude mode and then click the include button.</p&gt <p&gtWhen paired with the PE953, simply go to the PE953 and choose Reset Device. Then go to the PE653 and click include.</p&gt
