The AMZ Solar supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

## Overview

The AMZ Z-Wave Solar Awning Blind is intended for installation in Fakro roof windows and is adapted to cooperation with elements of wireless remote control system offered by FAKRO and other manufacturers offering products with Z-Wave logo. The awning blind is equipped with a two-way radio communication module. For communication, Z-Wave utilizes radio wave frequency of 868,42 MHz.

### Inclusion Information

Start the INCLUDE procedure by means of the controller of the existing network and then press the “Programming” button on the awning blind being added to the network.

### Exclusion Information

Put your controller into exclusion mode, then press the programming button on the awning blind for longer than 1 sec.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the AMZ Solar -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Switch | switch_binary | switch_binary | Switch | Switch | 
| Blinds Control | blinds_control | blinds_control | Blinds | Rollershutter | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | system.battery_level | Battery | Number |

### Switch
Switch the power on and off.

The ```switch_binary``` channel is of type ```switch_binary``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Switch``` category.

### Blinds Control
Provides start / stop control of blinds.

The ```blinds_control``` channel is of type ```blinds_control``` and supports the ```Rollershutter``` item and is in the ```Blinds``` category.

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.

| 2 | Include in All Off group |
| 255 | Include in All On and All Off groups |

This parameter has the configuration ID ```switchall_mode``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The AMZ Solar supports 4 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Basic Repeat


Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Multilevel Repeat


Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 4: Basic Control


Association group 4 supports 5 nodes.
