The ZWS12 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

FAKRO ZWS12 chain motor thanks to their small dimensions and suitable force output are ideal for roof window operating, being fully compatible with the Z-Wave Plus system. The motors can be applied in both centre pivot and top hung and pivot roof windows as well as windows of non-standard dimensions. 

The chain has **2 output speed **and reach 24cm. 

The ZWS12 motor is equipped with **encoder and two limit switches**:

limit switch at maximum chain travel position, overload limit in both directions (used mainly when closing the window).

This product can be operated in any Z-Wave network with other Z-Wave certified devices from other manufacturers.

ZWS12 also can be **controlled manually **by button and **closed by rain sensor and timer**.

**Reset:**

Device Reset Locally – This function allows you to reset the Z-Wave network without the use of Z-Wave controller. Press 5 times the programming button P fast, the actuator was removed from the Z-Wave network, restore the default parameters, name and locations.

Please use this procedure only when the network primary controller is missing or otherwise inoperable.

### Inclusion Information

**Autoinclusion** - This feature allow you to add hard to reach devices to Z-Wave network. 3-times ON and OFF the power actuator (OFF-ON-OFFON-OFF-ON) causes the introduction of actuator to Autoinclusion mode.

Please note that the procedure has been started the time between on and off can not exceed 20s. Autoinclusion mode is activated for a maximum of 10 minutes. During this time, we can add an actuator to any Z-Wave controller running in the Include procedure.

**Include** - This function allow you to add actuator to the network Z-Wave.

Follow the procedure adding device to the network Z-Wave according to user manual supplied with the product. Then, press the programming button P on the actuator for 1 second.

### Exclusion Information

**Exclude** - This function allow you to remove actuator from the network Z-Wave. Follow the procedure removing device from the network Z-Wave according to user manual supplied with the product. Then, press the programming button P on the actuator for 1 second. Function removes information only about network Z-Wave.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZWS12 supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Position reporting
Life Line – group for position reporting actuator after each a stoppage and alarm reporting (overcurrent, damage encoders). This group can be a maximum 1 device.

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Basic Repeat

Basic commands
Basic Repeat – group used to transfer the received basic commands to the devices included in this group. This group can be a maximum 5 devices.

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Multilevel Repeat

Transfer the received multilevel commands
Multilevel Repeat – group used to transfer the received multilevel commands to the devices included in this group. This group can be a maximum 5 devices.

Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.
