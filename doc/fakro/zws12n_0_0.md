The ZWS12n supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

<p&gtFAKRO ZWS12 chain motor thanks to their small dimensions and suitable force output are ideal for roof window operating, being fully compatible with the Z-Wave Plus system. The motors can be applied in both centre pivot and top hung and pivot roof windows as well as windows of non-standard dimensions. </p&gt <p&gtThe chain has <strong&gt2 output speed </strong&gtand reach 24cm. </p&gt <p&gtThe ZWS12 motor is equipped with <strong&gtencoder and two limit switches</strong&gt:</p&gt <p&gtlimit switch at maximum chain travel position, overload limit in both directions (used mainly when closing the window).</p&gt <p&gtThis product can be operated in any Z-Wave network with other Z-Wave certified devices from other manufacturers.</p&gt <p&gtZWS12 also can be <strong&gtcontrolled manually </strong&gtby button and <strong&gtclosed by rain sensor and timer</strong&gt.</p&gt <p&gtZ-Wave Plus Secure Enabled Product</p&gt <p&gtThis device is a security enabled Z-Wave Plus product that is able to use encrypted Z-Wave Plus messages to communicate to other security enabled Z-Wave Plus products.</p&gt <p&gt<strong&gtTechnical Parameters:</strong&gt </p&gt <ul&gt<li&gtChain reach: 240 mm</li&gt <li&gtOutput power : 9 W</li&gt <li&gtRated current: 0.72 A</li&gt <li&gtStandby current: 0.03 A</li&gt <li&gtChain pushing force: 200 N</li&gt <li&gtClosing force: 200 N</li&gt <li&gtCurrent limit: YES</li&gt <li&gtPower voltage: 15V DC</li&gt <li&gtPower cable: 2 x 0.75 mm2 (0,4 m)</li&gt </ul&gt<p&gt<strong&gtReset:</strong&gt</p&gt <p&gtDevice Reset Locally – This function allows you to reset the Z-Wave network without the use of Z-Wave controller. Press 5 times the programming button P fast, the actuator was removed from the Z-Wave network, restore the default parameters, name and locations.</p&gt <p&gtPlease use this procedure only when the network primary controller is missing or otherwise inoperable.</p&gt

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZWS12n supports 4 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Position reporting
<p&gtLife Line – group for position reporting actuator after each a stoppage and alarm reporting (overcurrent, damage encoders). This group can be a maximum 1 device.</p&gt

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Basic Repeat

Basic commands
<p&gtBasic Repeat – group used to transfer the received basic commands to the devices included in this group. This group can be a maximum 5 devices.</p&gt

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Multilevel Repeat

Transfer the received multilevel commands
<p&gtMultilevel Repeat – group used to transfer the received multilevel commands to the devices included in this group. This group can be a maximum 5 devices.</p&gt

Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 4: Basic Rain

Transfer the received commands from actuator & rain detector to the devices
<p&gtBasic Rain – group used to transfer the received commands from actuator & rain detector to the devices included in this group. This group can be a maximum 5 devices.</p&gt

Association group 4 supports 5 nodes.
