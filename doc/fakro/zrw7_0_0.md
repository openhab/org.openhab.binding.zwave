# ZRW7 Z-Wave Controller
This describes the Z-Wave device *ZRW7*, manufactured by *Fakro* with the thing type UID of ```fakro_zrw7_00_000```.

The device is in the category of *Battery*, defining Batteries, Energy Storages.

The ZRW7 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

The ZRW7 control keypad is designed for the remote control of devices compatible with the Z-Wave standard. The control keypad enables to operate up to 12 devices in each of 7 groups (a total of 84 devices). The currently selected group is marked with one of LEDs from 1 to 7.

The ZRW7 control keypad can act as PRIMARY and SECONDARY controller.

### Inclusion Information

By default the ZRW7 is the primary controller.

ASSIGN ZRW7 AS PRIMARY  
This function allows to add devices to Z-Wave network, while assigning it to selected group.  
Hold simultaneously UP and STOP buttons until one of LEDs starts blinking. Using UP / DOWN buttons to select function 1. Accept using STOP button. Within 12 seconds enter the device being added into programming mode. If procedure performed correctly all green LEDs blink once. On error. All LEDs blink red multiple times.

ASSIGN ZRW7 AS SECONDARY  
This function allows to assign the ZRW7 to existing Z-Wave network as SECONDARY controller. PRIMARY controller within this network can be of any type. Devices must be added to selected group of the controller (see its user manual) in order to be controlled by SECONDARY controller.  
Hold simultaneously DOWN and STOP buttons until one of LEDs starts blinking. Using UP / DOWN buttons to select function 1. Accept using STOP button. Within 12 seconds run on PRIMARY controller ADD TO NETWORK function. If procedure performed correctly all green LEDs blink once. On error. All LEDs blink red multiple times.

### Exclusion Information

When the ZRW7 is the primary controller: Hold simultaneously DOWN and STOP buttons until one of LEDs starts blinking. Using UP / DOWN buttons to select function 3. Accept using STOP button. Follow the instructions on the device to be excluded (within 12 seconds). If the procedure performed correctly all green LEDs blink once. On error all LEDs blink red multiple times.  
Remark: you can exclude any included device this way, even if the ZRW7 remote controller has been reset to factory defaults.   

### Wakeup Information

The ZRW7 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


Hold simultaneously UP and STOP buttons until one of LEDs starts blinking. Using UP / DOWN buttons to select function 5. Accept using STOP button. LEDs flash sequentially, clockwise. The ZRW7 remains in the listening mode 12 seconds after the end of data transmission.

### General Usage Information



## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the ZRW7 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Dimmer | switch_dimmer | switch_dimmer | DimmableLight | Dimmer | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | system.battery_level | Battery | Number |

### Dimmer
The brightness channel allows to control the brightness of a light.
            It is also possible to switch the light on and off.

The ```switch_dimmer``` channel is of type ```switch_dimmer``` and supports the ```Dimmer``` item and is in the ```DimmableLight``` category.

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.


## Device Configuration

The device has no configuration parameters defined.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZRW7 supports 8 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.


Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Channel 1


Association group 2 supports 12 nodes.

### Group 3: Channel 2


Association group 3 supports 12 nodes.

### Group 4: Channel 3


Association group 4 supports 12 nodes.

### Group 5: Channel 4


Association group 5 supports 12 nodes.

### Group 6: Channel 5


Association group 6 supports 12 nodes.

### Group 7: Channel 6


Association group 7 supports 12 nodes.

### Group 8: Channel 7


Association group 8 supports 12 nodes.
