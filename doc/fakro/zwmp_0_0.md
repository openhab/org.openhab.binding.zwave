## Overview

The ZWMP weather module (performing the controlling function similarly to the ZWP10 remote control and ZWK10 keyboard) enables remote control of electronic accessories compatible with the Z-Wave system, e.g. ZWS12 or ZWS30 motors for operating FAKRO roof windows. This module is equipped with three digital inputs (No. 7, 8 and 9 in Figure 1) into which signals from various external devices can be plugged, e.g. rain or wind sensors, thermostat, timer switch, EIB system, etc. This module can operate up to 231 devices simultaneously or in groups

### Inclusion Information
