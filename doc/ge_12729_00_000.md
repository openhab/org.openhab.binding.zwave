# 12729 In-Wall Smart Dimmer

This describes the Z-Wave device *12729*, manufactured by *Jasco Products* with the thing type UID of ```ge_12729_00_000```. 

In-Wall Smart Dimmer  


### Inclusion Information 

1. Follow the instructions for your Z-wave certified controller to include a device to the Z-wave network.

2. Once the controller is ready to include your device, press up and release the toggle switch to include it in the network.

Note: Your controller may need to be within 10 feet of the device to be included.

3. Once your controller has confirmed that the device has been included, refresh the Z-wave network to optimize performance.

### Dimmer

#### Restore Last Value

Restore Last Dimming level on ON.


| Property         | Value    |
|------------------|----------|
| Configuration ID | config_restoreLastValue |
| Data Type        | BOOLEAN || Default Value | true |
| Options | Restore Last Value (true) |
|  | Restore Full Brightness (false) |


### Device Configuration
The following table provides a summary of the configuration parameters available in the 12729 In-Wall Smart Dimmer.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found below.

| Parameter   | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| 4: Invert Switch | Invert the ON/OFF Switch State. |
| 7: On/Off Command Dim Step | Indicates how many levels the dimmer will change for each dimming step. |
| 8: On/Off Command Dim Rate | This sets how often the dim level will change. |
| 9: Local Control Dim Step | Indicates how many levels the dimmer will change for each dimming step. |
| 10: Local Control Dim Rate | This sets how often the dim level will change. |
| 11: ALL ON/ALL OFF Dim Step | Indicates how many levels the dimmer will change for each dimming step. |
| 12: ALL ON/ALL OFF Dim Rate | This sets how often the dim level will change. |


#### 4: Invert Switch

Invert the ON/OFF Switch State.  


##### Overview 

If the switch is accidentally installed upside down with “On” at the bottom and “Off” at the top, the default On/Off rocker settings can be reversed by changing parameter 4’s value to “1”.


| Property         | Value    |
|------------------|----------|
| Configuration ID | config_4_1 |
| Data Type        | INTEGER || Default Value | 0 |
| Options | No (0) |
|  | Yes (1) |


#### 7: On/Off Command Dim Step

Indicates how many levels the dimmer will change for each dimming step.


| Property         | Value    |
|------------------|----------|
| Configuration ID | config_7_1 |
| Data Type        | INTEGER |
| Range | 1 to 99 |
| Default Value | 1 |


#### 8: On/Off Command Dim Rate

This sets how often the dim level will change.  


##### Overview 

The timing of the steps can be adjusted in 10 millisecond intervals. As an example, the default setting for parameter 8 is “3”. This means that the lighting level will change every 30 milliseconds when the Dim Command is received. A value of 255 would mean that the level would change every 2.55 seconds. Combined, the two parameters allow dim rate adjustments from 10 milliseconds to 4.2 minutes to go from maximum-to-minimum or minimum-to-maximum brightness levels.


| Property         | Value    |
|------------------|----------|
| Configuration ID | config_8_1 |
| Data Type        | INTEGER |
| Range | 1 to 255 |
| Default Value | 3 |


#### 9: Local Control Dim Step

Indicates how many levels the dimmer will change for each dimming step.


| Property         | Value    |
|------------------|----------|
| Configuration ID | config_9_1 |
| Data Type        | INTEGER |
| Range | 1 to 99 |
| Default Value | 1 |


#### 10: Local Control Dim Rate

This sets how often the dim level will change.  


##### Overview 

The timing of the steps can be adjusted in 10 millisecond intervals. As an example, the default setting for parameter 8 is “3”. This means that the lighting level will change every 30 milliseconds when the Dim Command is received. A value of 255 would mean that the level would change every 2.55 seconds. Combined, the two parameters allow dim rate adjustments from 10 milliseconds to 4.2 minutes to go from maximum-to-minimum or minimum-to-maximum brightness levels.


| Property         | Value    |
|------------------|----------|
| Configuration ID | config_10_1 |
| Data Type        | INTEGER |
| Range | 1 to 255 |
| Default Value | 3 |


#### 11: ALL ON/ALL OFF Dim Step

Indicates how many levels the dimmer will change for each dimming step.


| Property         | Value    |
|------------------|----------|
| Configuration ID | config_11_1 |
| Data Type        | INTEGER |
| Range | 1 to 99 |
| Default Value | 1 |


#### 12: ALL ON/ALL OFF Dim Rate

This sets how often the dim level will change.  


##### Overview 

The timing of the steps can be adjusted in 10 millisecond intervals. As an example, the default setting for parameter 8 is “3”. This means that the lighting level will change every 30 milliseconds when the Dim Command is received. A value of 255 would mean that the level would change every 2.55 seconds. Combined, the two parameters allow dim rate adjustments from 10 milliseconds to 4.2 minutes to go from maximum-to-minimum or minimum-to-maximum brightness levels.


| Property         | Value    |

| Configuration ID | config_12_1 |
| Data Type        | INTEGER |
| Range | 1 to 255 |
| Default Value | 3 |
