The DMDP1 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The DMDP1 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

From Dome Home Automation, monitor every door in your house with the window / door sensor PRO, including your mailbox door! The Door/Window PRO magnet is 1/4” wide, and the magnet can be placed up to one inch away from the sensor which means you can place it nearly anywhere to keep track of openings in places you may have never thought possible. Use the Dome Home Automation Z-Wave Door/Window Sensor PRO to secure cabinets, windows, doors and other fixtures you want to keep closed or monitor activity around. Did we mention the PRO’s battery life is 10 years and it has a range of 260 feet? And just when you thought it couldn't get any better, the new Door/Window Sensor Pro also monitors the ambient temperature! Use the temperature information to monitor for extreme temperature fluctuation and keep your house safe from frozen pipes or damaged flooring.

### Inclusion Information

**Inclusion - New Installation**

  1. For proper inclusion, bring the Door/Window Sensor to the final location where it will be used*.
  2. Follow the instructions for your Z-Wave controller to enter inclusion mode.
  3. Remove the Battery Tab protruding from the Battery Tab Slit.
  4. The device will automatically enter inclusion mode for two minutes and the LED Indicator will alternate between green and red.

Upon successful inclusion the LED Indicator will flash green three times then stop blinking.

**Inclusion - Re-Installation**

  1. For proper inclusion, bring the Door/Window Sensorto the final location where it will be used*.
  2. Follow the instructions for your Z-Wave controller to enter inclusion mode.
  3. Remove the Sensor Cover and the LED Indicator will start blinking yellow.
  4. Press the Button quickly 3 times in a row.
  5. The device will enter inclusion mode for two minutes and the LED Indicator will alternate between green and red.

### Exclusion Information

**Exclusion**

Follow the instructions for your Z-Wave Certified Controller to enter exclusion mode. When prompted by the controller:

  1. Remove the SENSOR COVER and the LED Indicator will start blinking red.
  2. Press the Button quickly 3 times in a row.

The LED Indicator will flash green three times indicating exclusion/disconnection and will then continue flashing red (indicating tamper) until the cover is replaced.

### Wakeup Information

The DMDP1 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


**Waking Up the Door/Window Sensor Pro**

Because the Mouser is a battery powered device, it wakes up on regular intervals to give battery and other status updates to the controller, as well as to accept configuration settings from the controller. This helps to extend the battery life. The device can be forced to wake up to submit these reports or accept new settings immediately by simply pressing and holding the BUTTON for half a second. The LED INDICATOR will flash once indicating successful wake up.

### General Usage Information

### Description & Features

The Dome Door/Window Sensor is a battery powered security-enabled\* Z-Wave Plus magnetic reed switch that can monitor the status of doors, windows, and anything else that opens and closes. It can also report ambient temperature levels. The Door/Window Sensor consists of two parts - the “sensor,” and the “magnet.” The sensor has a “reed switch” inside, which is sensitive to the magnet’s presence when aligned properly and within the defined distance. When the sensor and magnet are brought together or pulled apart, the sensor will report its open/close status to its Z-Wave controller, and the encrypted wireless communication\* ensures that user data remains secure. Because many manufacturers use Z-Wave to communicate, the Door/Window Sensor can interact with different products of different categories.

**Key Features**

  * Temperature Sensor
  * Up to 220’ range
  * Ten-Year Battery Life
  * Z-Wave Signal Strength Indication
  * 1” Max distance between sensor & magnet
  * Ultra-Narrow (1/4”) Magnet (for Placement Between Door and Casing)
  * Z-Wave Plus Certified
  * S0 Security-Enabled*
  * Monitor doors, windows, medicine cabinets, drawers, garage doors, and many other openings

*A security-enabled Z-Wave Plus controller is required to use all features of the Door/Window Sensor.

### Factory Reset & Misc. Functions

**Resetting the Door/Window Sensor Pro**

If needed, the Door/Window Sensor Pro can be reset locally by following these steps. Only do this when your Z-Wave controller is disconnected or otherwise unreachable. Beware that resetting your device will disconnect it from the system

  1. Remove the Sensor Cover and confirm that your Door/Window Sensor is powered up.
  2. Wait for 5 seconds.
  3. Move the Magnet and Sensor Base in and out of the closed position 6 times.
  4. The LED Indicator will light up red for two seconds when reset successfully.

The Door/Window Sensor’s memory will be erased to factory settings.

### Physical Installation

The Door/Window Sensor can be install with double stick tape or the provided screws. The device should already be included in your Z-Wave system before continuing further.

**Pre-Installation Checklist**

  * The Magnet Assembly and Sensor Assembly should be less than 1-1/4” apart when closed (Figure 3.)
  * Hold the Magnet Assembly and Sensor Assembly in place by hand where you wish to install them, move them in and out of the closed position, and make sure the LED Indicator blinks in response. This will confirm that the door and frame are spaced correctly to accommodate the sensor.
  * When moving the Magnet and Sensor in and out of the closed position, a Green followed by another Green or Red LED Indicator corresponds to Excellent or Poor Z-Wave Signal strength respectively.
  * Make sure the Sensor Cover Release Button will be accessible in the final position.
  * The Magnet is small enough (only 1/4” wide) to fit in the groove between the door and the casing.
  * Finally, confirm that you are still within range of your Z-Wave controller.

Values in the range 0 to 0 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_9_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The DMDP1 supports 5 association groups.

### Group 1: Group 1

Group 1 (Lifeline Group)
Group 1 is the “Lifeline” group, which can hold five members, typically including the main Z-Wave controller. The Door/Window Sensor sends this group a Notification Report or a Binary Sensor Report when it is opened or closed (see Configuration Parameter 3.) It also sends this group a multilevel sensor report to report the temperature and a Battery Report in response to Battery Get commands.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Group 2

Group 2
Group 2 supports up to 5 members and the Door/Window Sensor sends a Basic Set command to this group (or the Control Group) to directly trigger devices (like a light, chime, etc.) when the tamper switch either opens or closes. The value of the Basic Set command (e.g. brightness of the lamp) is configured using configuration parameter 07.

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Group 3

Group 3
Group 3 supports up to 5 members and the Door/Window Sensor sends it a NOTIFICATION\_REPORT or SENSOR\_BINARY_REPORT when the tamper switch either opens or closes.

Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 4: Group 4

Group 4
Group 4 supports up to 5 members and the Door/Window Sensor sends a Basic Set command to this group to directly trigger devices (like a light, chime, etc.) when the sensor detects the door/window opening. The value of the Basic Set command (e.g. brightness of the lamp) is configured using configuration parameter 08 and 09.

Association group 4 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 5: Group 5

Group 5
Group 5 supports up to 5 members and the Door/Window Sensor sends it a NOTIFICATION\_REPORT or SENSOR\_BINARY_REPORT when the sensor detects the door/window opening.

Association group 5 supports 5 nodes.
