The DMWS1 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The DMWS1 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

The Dome Leak Sensor is a battery powered Z-Wave Plus device that can detect wetness and send a notification when it does so. The Leak Sensor consists of two parts—the “SENSOR ASSEMBLY,” and the optional “REMOTE SENSOR PROBE.” They both detect water similarly, using three visible “LEAD.” The moment water touches any of the LEAD, the device will beep and send a notification with its moisture status to its Z-Wave controller.

### Inclusion Information

Put controller in inclusion mode.

Remove cover from device, remove tab from battery (if present), and press button 3 times rapidly.

### Exclusion Information

Put controller in exclusion mode.

Remove cover from device and press button 3 times rapidly.

### Wakeup Information

The DMWS1 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


Remove cover from device, then press and hold the button for two seconds. The LED INDICATOR will flash once indicating successful wake up. If this doesn't wake up the device, try triple-clicking the button. This causes the device to emit a NIF frame, which the binding treats as a wake up.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the DMWS1 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Binary Sensor | sensor_binary | sensor_binary |  | Switch | 
| Alarm (flood) | alarm_flood | alarm_flood | Water | Switch | 
| Alarm (general) | alarm_general | alarm_general | Alarm | Switch | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | system.battery_level | Battery | Number |

### Binary Sensor
The Leak Sensor also sends a Binary Sensor Report when a leak is detected or removed.  See below for the SENSOR\_BINARY\_REPORT parameters sent:  
Sensor Type: 06 (Water)  
Leak Detected Value: 0xFF  
Leak Removed Value: 0x00

Indicates if a sensor has triggered.

The ```sensor_binary``` channel is of type ```sensor_binary``` and supports the ```Switch``` item. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| ON | Triggered |
| OFF | Untriggered |

### Alarm (flood)
Indicates if the flood alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_flood``` channel is of type ```alarm_flood``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Water``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |

### Alarm (general)
Indicates if an alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_general``` channel is of type ```alarm_general``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Alarm``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|

Values in the range 0 to 255 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```255```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_7_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The DMWS1 supports 4 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Group 1 is the “Lifeline” group, which can hold five members, typically including the main Z-Wave controller.  The Leak Sensor sends this group a Notification Report and a Binary Sensor Report when water is detected or removed.  It also sends this group a Battery Report in reponse to Battery Get commands and a Locally Reset Notification upon local reset.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Control

Group to receive BASIC_SET on leak change
The Leak Sensor sends a Basic Set command to Association Group 2 (or the Control Group) to directly trigger devices (like a light, chime, etc.) in response to a detected leak. Then, after the leak is no longer detected, a BASIC_SET(0x00) command is sent to reset the device (e.g. turn off the light.) The value of the Basic Set command (e.g. brightness of the lamp) is configured using configuration parameter 7. 

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Notification

Group 3 supports up to 5 members and the Leak Sensor sends it a NOTIFICATION_REPORT when water is detected or removed

Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 4: Sensor Binary 

Group 4 supports up to 5 members and the Leak Sensor sends it a SENSOR\_BINARY\_REPORT when water is detected or removed.

Association group 4 supports 5 nodes.
