The DMOF1 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

The Dome On/Off Plug-In Switch is a Z-Wave Plus device that plugs into a standard 3-prong power outlet and lets you turn on or off any connected electronic device. The On/Off Plug-In Switch also monitors how much energy the attached device uses, and reports the data to your Z-Wave Hub.

### Inclusion Information

Quickly press the BUTTON 3 times. A yellow LED will flash five times indicating inclusion.

### Exclusion Information

Press the BUTTON quickly 3 times in a row. A yellow LED will flash five times indicating exclusion/disconnection.

### Parameter 1: Disable Meter Functionality

Enable/Disable the meter report.
This parameter enables/disables the METER_REPORT function, which sends periodic reports to Group1 members with information on line voltage, current load, and power & energy consumption. Also see Param 2 & 6.
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Disable Meter Functionality |
| 1 | Enable Meter Functionality |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (Enable Meter Functionality).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: METER_REPORT

The time between meter reports.
This parameter sets the amount of time between each successive METER_REPORT signal sent to Group 1 (also see Param 1 & 6.)

### Parameter 3: Set "Overload" Current level

Maximum current the plug will pass
Sets the maximum current the plug will pass before it cuts off power and sends a NOTIFICATION\_EVENT\_POWER_ MANAGEMENT\_OVER\_LOAD\_DETECTED signal to Group 1 and a BASIC\_SET(FF) to Group 2. The LED will then blink red once per second until the current returns to normal. To clear the NOTIFICATION and start monitoring again, the BUTTON must be pushed once (only after the current is back to normal.) **NOTE: this value must be higher than Param 4**
Values in the range 1 to 16 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```13```.

### Parameter 4: Set "Alert" Current Level

Current level warning threshold
Sets the current level at which the On/Off Plug-In Switch will flash its LED yellow, until the current returns to below this level. It will NOT cut off current to the device; this functions as a visible warning to the user. **NOTE: this value must be lower than Param 3**
Values in the range 1 to 16 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```12```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_4_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The DMOF1 supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Group 1 is the “Lifeline” group, which can hold five devices. The On/Off Plug-In Switch sends this group a Notification Report and Binary Switch Report whenever it is turned on or off. It also sends a Meter Report incrementally based on time (see Param 2,) or when a relative change in power usage is detected (see Param 6.) Finally, the On/Off Plug-In Switch sends this group a Device Reset Locally notification to remove itself from the Z-Wave network. 

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Group 2

The On/Off Plug-In Switch sends a BASIC\_SET(FF) command to Association Group 2 to directly trigger devices (like a siren, chime, etc.) when the current passes above the level set in Parameter 3. When the current drops below the level again, a BASIC\_SET(00) command is sent to reset the device (e.g. turn off the siren.) This Group can hold five devices.

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Group 3

The On/Off Plug-In Switch sends Notification Reports to Group 3, and it can hold five devices.

Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.
