The DMMZ1 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The DMMZ1 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

The Dome Mouser is a battery powered Z-Wave Plus enabled mousetrap that works by electrocution and is designed to be humane and painless to the rodent. After a mouse is caught, the Mouser will send a Z-Wave signal to its controller to notify the user, and will not retrigger until the trap is reset. 

### Inclusion Information

Press the CONNECT BUTTON quickly 3 times in a row. The LED INDICATOR will flash five times indicating inclusion

### Exclusion Information

Press the CONNECT BUTTON quickly 3 times in a row. The LED INDICATOR will flash five times indicating exclusion/disconnection. 

### Wakeup Information

The DMMZ1 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


The device can be forced to wake up to submit reports or accept new settings immediately by simply pressing and holding the BUTTON for two seconds. The LED INDICATOR will flash once indicating successful wake up

### General Usage Information

# How to Use—Baiting the Trap

  1. Lift the BAIT HOLDER from the Mouser.
  2. Add bait - dry foods (like peanuts) leave less mess.
  3. Replace the BAIT HOLDER.

How to Use—Setting the Trap

  1. Bait the Mouser.
  2. Place the Mouser in the desired location - rodents usually scurry around walls and other corners.
  3. Flip On/Off Button to the On position - the LED will stay lit for two seconds indicating the Mouser is armed. A flashing LED indicates low battery.
  4. When the Mouser is tripped. the LED will blink every five seconds, and an alert will be sent to your Z-Wave Controller.
  5. Flip the On/Off Button to the Off position to empty the Mouser, andit is ready to use again immediately

00 (0/Turn Off Device)

01 ~ 63 (0-99)

FF (255/Turn On Device)
Values in the range 0 to 255 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```255```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Set Firing Mode

This parameter sets the “firing mode” of the Mouser.
This parameter sets “firing mode” of the Mouser. Two firing modes are available: in the first (Continuous Fire,) electricity is passed continuously for the entire duration, and in the second (Burst Fire,) electricity is passed continuously only for the first minute and it is pulsed at approximately 400 beats per minute for the remainder of the time.

Values in the range 0 to 255 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_5_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The DMMZ1 supports 4 association groups.

### Group 1: Group 1

Group 1 is the “Lifeline” group, which can hold five members, typically including the main Z-Wave controller. The Door/Window Sensor sends this group a Notification Report and a Binary Sensor Report when it is tripped, reset, armed, and disarmed. It also sends this group a Battery Report in response to Battery Get commands.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Group 2

The Mouser sends a Basic Set command to Association Group 2 (or the Control Group) to directly trigger devices (like a light, chime, etc.) when it is tripped. After the trap is reset, a BASIC_SET(00) command is sent to reset the device (e.g. turn off the light.) The value of the Basic Set command (e.g. brightness of the lamp) is configured using configuration parameter 1.

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Group 3

Group 3 supports up to 5 members and the Mouser sends it a NOTIFICATION_REPORT when tripped, reset, armed, and disarmed.

Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 4: Group 4

Group 4 supports up to 5 members and the Mouser sends it a SENSOR\_BINARY\_REPORT when tripped, reset, armed, and disarmed.

Association group 4 supports 5 nodes.
