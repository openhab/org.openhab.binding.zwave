The WDTC-20 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

The Wayne-Dalton Z-Wave® Enabled Thermostat is compatible with most standard 24 Volt heating and cooling systems including:

  * 1 and 2 stage heat pump systems
  * 1 or 2 stage normal heating systems
  * 1 stage cooling systems

The Wayne-Dalton Z-Wave® Enabled Thermostat also features:

  * Support for all Z-Wave® controllers
  * “Home” and “Away” programs via Z-Wave® or manual operation
  * “Heat” and “Cool” modes via Z-Wave® or manual operation
  * Temperature setting up or down via Z-Wave® or manual operation
  * Easy Energy Savings buttons and Mode Switch
  * Low Battery indicator

The Z-Wave® Enabled Thermostat is a new arrival into the Wayne-Dalton Z-Wave® product line and contains many new features that were not conceived when some Z-Wave® controllers were initially developed. The Wayne-Dalton Z-Wave® Enabled Thermostat has a special compatibility mode and is designed to work with your Z-Wave® network regardless of the manufacturer of your controller or its date of manufacture. When programming your thermostat to your controller, if it does not respond to the commands, reprogram it using the alternate programming method.

The Z-Wave® Enabled Thermostat is designed to live by your schedule rather than forcing you to live by the rigid schedule it was programmed with. Now you can program it to the “Away” Scene on a controller such as the Wireless Gateway and when you leave the house you can activate that Scene from your car to set-back your thermostat, then when you arrive home, you can activate the “Home” Scene to return the thermostat to your normal setting.

### Inclusion Information
