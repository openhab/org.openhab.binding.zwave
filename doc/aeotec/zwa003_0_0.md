The Aeotec NanoMote Quad supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The Aeotec NanoMote Quad does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

Aeotec NanoMote Quad has been crafted to control connected lighting using Z-Wave Plus as a Z-Wave S2 device. It is powered by Aeotec’s Gen5 technology. You can find out more about NanoMote Quad by following that link.

  
To see whether NanoMote Quad is known to be compatible with your Z-Wave system or not, please reference our Z-Wave gateway comparison listing. The technical specifications of NanoMote Quad can be viewed at that link.

2. Z-Wave S2 system  
3. Support remote control anywhere and anytime  
4. Program up to 4 customized scenes  
5. The battery is rechargeable and replacable, will run for three months per charge  
6. Support low battery alarm with buzzer  
7. Support Child Lock function  
8. Supports OTA firmware update

### Inclusion Information

**Adding your NanoMote Quad to your Z-Wave network.**

With your  NanoMote Quad now powered, it’s time to add it to your Z-Wave network.

**1. **Place your Z-Wave primary controller/gateway enter into pairing/inclusion mode. 

**2. **Take your NanoMote near to your primary controller.  

**3.** Double click the NanoMote button (can be any button), the LED will blink rapidly with a white color. 

**4.** If your NanoMote has been successfully added to your Z-Wave  network, its white LED will be solid for about 10 seconds, then flash green to indicate it is awake. If the adding was unsuccessful and the red LED will be solid for 2 seconds and then off, repeat the above steps.

**5. **If your NanoMote does not go to sleep on its own, press and hold for 2 seconds (or until LED turns orange) then release its button to put your NanoMote to sleep.

### Exclusion Information

Your NanoMote can be removed from your Z-Wave network at any time. You'll need to use your Z-Wave network's main controller/gateway. To do this, please refer to the part of their respective manuals that tell you how to remove devices from your network.

**1. **Put your primary controller into device removal mode.

**2. **Take your NanoMote near to your primary controller.  

**3.** Double click the NanoMote button (can be any button), the LED will become a solid green color.

**4.** If your NanoMote has been removed from your Z-Wave  network, its LED will begin cycling through rainbow colors. 

### Wakeup Information

The Aeotec NanoMote Quad does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


**Send a wake up notification.**

In order to send your NanoMote Quad new configuration commands, OTA, or receive other commands from your Z-Wave controller or gateway, it will need to be woken up.

Enable Wakeup:

  1. Press and hold button (any button) for 5 seconds or until LED turns to a green color  
  
    LED will change from:  
  
    Orange  
    Green //at 5 seconds.  
  
    
  2. Release the button and the LED will flash green rapidly to indicate it is in an awake state.

Disable Wakeup:

  1. Press and hold button (any button) for 2 seconds or until LED turns to a orange/red color
  2. Release the button and the LED should be deactivated

### General Usage Information

The NanoMote Quad supports 9 association groups, all control buttons can activate the configured scenes via sending the Central Scene Notifications to primary controller/gateway (In association group 1). In order to use Association Groups, make sure that your gateway or software can allow you to set these (ie: Vera Group Association Setup), in order to do so, please refer to your gateways manual on setting group association. This will allow the NanoMote Quad to directly communicate ON/OFF or Dimming commands to your devices without going through your gateway.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the Aeotec NanoMote Quad -:

| Channel | Channel Id | Category | Item Type |
|---------|------------|----------|-----------|
| Dimmer | switch_dimmer | DimmableLight | Dimmer | 
| Scene Number | scene_number |  | Number | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | Battery | Number |

### Dimmer
The brightness channel allows to control the brightness of a light.
            It is also possible to switch the light on and off.

The ```switch_dimmer``` channel supports the ```Dimmer``` item and is in the ```DimmableLight``` category.

### Scene Number
Triggers when a scene button is pressed.

The ```scene_number``` channel supports the ```Number``` item.
This channel provides the scene, and the event as a decimal value in the form ```<scene>.<event>```. The scene number is set by the device, and the event is as follows -:

| Event ID | Event Description  |
|----------|--------------------|
| 0        | Single key press   |
| 1        | Key released       |
| 2        | Key held down      |
| 3        | Double keypress    |
| 4        | Tripple keypress   |
| 5        | 4 x keypress       |
| 6        | 5 x keypress       |

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```battery-level``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.



## Device Configuration

The device has no configuration parameters defined.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The device does not support associations.
