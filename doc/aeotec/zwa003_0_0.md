### Inclusion Information

**Adding your NanoMote Quad to your Z-Wave network.**

With your  NanoMote Quad now powered, it’s time to add it to your Z-Wave network.

  1. Place your Z-Wave primary controller/gateway enter into pairing/inclusion mode. 
  2. Take your NanoMote near to your primary controller.  
  3. Double click the NanoMote button (can be any button), the LED will blink rapidly with a white color. 
  4. If your NanoMote has been successfully added to your Z-Wave  network, its white LED will be solid for about 10 seconds, then flash green to indicate it is awake. If the adding was unsuccessful and the red LED will be solid for 2 seconds and then off, repeat the above steps.
  5. If your NanoMote does not go to sleep on its own, press and hold for 2 seconds (or until LED turns orange) then release its button to put your NanoMote to sleep.

### Exclusion Information

Your NanoMote can be removed from your Z-Wave network at any time. You'll need to use your Z-Wave network's main controller/gateway. To do this, please refer to the part of their respective manuals that tell you how to remove devices from your network.

  1. Put your primary controller into device removal mode.
  2. Take your NanoMote near to your primary controller.
  3. Double click the NanoMote button (can be any button), the LED will become a solid green color.
  4. If your NanoMote has been removed from your Z-Wave  network, its LED will begin cycling through rainbow colors. 

### Wakeup Information

The ZWA003 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


**Send a wake up notification.**

In order to send your NanoMote Quad new configuration commands, OTA, or receive other commands from your Z-Wave controller or gateway, it will need to be woken up.

Enable Wakeup:

  1. Press and hold button (any button) for 5 seconds or until LED turns to a green color  
  
    LED will change from:  
  
    Orange  
    Green //at 5 seconds.  
  
    
  2. Release the button and the LED will flash green rapidly to indicate it is in an awake state.

Disable Wakeup:

  1. Press and hold button (any button) for 2 seconds or until LED turns to a orange/red color
  2. Release the button and the LED should be deactivated

### General Usage Information

The NanoMote Quad supports 9 association groups, all control buttons can activate the configured scenes via sending the Central Scene Notifications to primary controller/gateway (In association group 1). In order to use Association Groups, make sure that your gateway or software can allow you to set these (ie: Vera Group Association Setup), in order to do so, please refer to your gateways manual on setting group association. This will allow the NanoMote Quad to directly communicate ON/OFF or Dimming commands to your devices without going through your gateway.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the ZWA003 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Dimmer | switch_dimmer | switch_dimmer | DimmableLight | Dimmer | 
| Scene Number | scene_number | scene_number |  | Number | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | system.battery_level | Battery | Number |

### Dimmer
The brightness channel allows to control the brightness of a light.
            It is also possible to switch the light on and off.

The ```switch_dimmer``` channel is of type ```switch_dimmer``` and supports the ```Dimmer``` item and is in the ```DimmableLight``` category.

### Scene Number
Triggers when a scene button is pressed.

The ```scene_number``` channel is of type ```scene_number``` and supports the ```Number``` item.
This channel provides the scene, and the event as a decimal value in the form ```<scene>.<event>```. The scene number is set by the device, and the event is as follows -:

| Event ID | Event Description  |
|----------|--------------------|
| 0        | Single key press   |
| 1        | Key released       |
| 2        | Key held down      |
| 3        | Double keypress    |

| 5        | 4 x keypress       |
| 6        | 5 x keypress       |

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.


## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 2 configuration parameters available in the ZWA003.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 32 | Level for low battery | Set the level for "low battery" alert |
| 43 | Low battery buzzer | Enable/disable low battery buzzer |
|  | Wakeup Interval | Sets the interval at which the device will accept commands from the controller |
|  | Wakeup Node | Sets the node ID of the device to receive the wakeup notifications |

### Parameter 32: Level for low battery

Set the level for "low battery" alert

Values in the range 10 to 50 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```20```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_32_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 43: Low battery buzzer

Enable/disable low battery buzzer

The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Disable |
| 1 | Enable |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Disable).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_43_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZWA003 supports 9 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Central scene notification

Association group 1 supports 1 node.
