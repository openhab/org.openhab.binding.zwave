The ZWA018 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The ZWA018 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

The AEOTEC Water Sensor 7 Basic is a sensor, which detects water leakage.

### Inclusion Information

**SmartStart Inclusion.**

You can use this method of inclusion only if your Z-Wave gateway/controller/hub supports SmartStart.

  1. Open up your Z-Wave gateway/controller/app.
  2. Select SmartStart inclusion.
  3. Scan the QR code located on the Water Sensor 7.
  4. Within 10 minutes after powering your Water Sensor 7, it will automatically get included into your Z-Wave gateway/controller/hub.

**Classic Inclusion**

  1. Set your Z-Wave controller into pairing mode.
  2. Triple-click the tamper switch on Water Sensor 7 - this begins to blink five times
  3. After completion of the inclusion, the LED will illuminate green for 3 seconds.
  4. If you pairing with S2 encryption/security, enter the first 5 digits of the DSK into your controller/gateway/hub interface when requested. 
  5. Close the cover

### Exclusion Information

Your sensor can be removed from your Z-Wave network at any time. You'll need to use your Z-Wave network's main controller/gateway. To do this, please refer to the part of your gateways respective manual that tells you how to remove devices from your network. 

  1. Set your Z-Wave controller into unpair mode.
  2. Triple-click the tamper switch on Water Sensor 7 within 1.5 seconds - this will cause the LED to blink five times.
  3. After a successful exclusion, it will light up its LED for 2 seconds then deactivate.

### Wakeup Information

The ZWA018 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


In order to send your sensors new configuration commands from your Z-Wave controller or gateway, it will need to be woken up. 

  1. Wake Up the device by removing the cover. 
  2. The hit the tamper switch once.

**Note:** Water Sensor 7 remains awake until the housing is closed again.

### General Usage Information

Indicates if a sensor has triggered.

The ```sensor_binary``` channel is of type ```sensor_binary``` and supports the ```Switch``` item. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| ON | Triggered |
| OFF | Untriggered |

### Alarm (flood)
Indicates if the flood alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_flood``` channel is of type ```alarm_flood``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Water``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |

### Alarm (burglar)
Indicates if the burglar alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_burglar``` channel is of type ```alarm_burglar``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Door``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |

### Alarm (power)
Indicates if a power alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_power``` channel is of type ```alarm_power``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZWA018 supports 4 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Lifeline


Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Basic

Control devices when water leakage is detected 


Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Alarm

Sends out alarm message when water leakage is detected


Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 4: Tamper

Sends alarm messages when tamper is tripped


Association group 4 supports 5 nodes.
