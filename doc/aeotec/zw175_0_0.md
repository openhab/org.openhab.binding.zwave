The ZW175 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

Aeotec Smart Switch 7 (SS7) has been crafted to power connected lighting using SmartStart, S2 framework, and Z-Wave Plus. It is powered by Aeotec’s S2 technology. 

  * Smart Switch 7 is intended for indoor use in dry locations only. Do not use in damp, moist, and/or wet locations.
  * Max-amperage: 15 amps for ZW175-A
  * May-amperage: 10 amps for ZW175-C

### Inclusion Information

Getting your Smart Switch up and running is as simple as plugging it into a wall socket and adding it to your Z-Wave network.

  1. Set your Z-Wave Controller into its 'Add Device' mode in order to add the product into your Z-Wave system. Refer to the Controller's manual if you are unsure of how to perform this step.
  2. Power your Smart Switch 7 to any outlet; its LED will be breathing a blue light if it is ready to be paired.
  3. Click Action Button 2 times slowly to set your Smart Switch 7 into pair mode.
  4. If your Z-Wave Controller supports S2 encryption, enter the first 5 digits of DSK into your Controller's interface if it is requested. The DSK is printed on its Smart Switch 7.  
    a) If pairing succeeds, it will become a bright blue light for 2 seconds. Smart Switch 7 is now a part of your Z-Wave home control system. You can configure it and its automation via your Z-Wave system; please refer to your software's user guide for precise instructions.  
    b) If pairing fails, it will light a solid bright red light for 2 seconds and then return to a breathing blue light; repeat steps 1 to 4 if this happens.

### Exclusion Information

Your Smart Switch can be removed from your Z-Wave network at any time. You’ll need to use your Z-Wave network’s main controller to do this and the following instructions will tell you how to do this using Aeotec by Aeon Labs’ Z-Stick or Minimote controller.  
  
If you are using other products as your main Z-Wave controller, please refer to the part of their respective manuals that tells you how to remove devices from your network.

If you're using an existing gateway:

  1. Set your Z-Wave Controller into its 'Remove Device' / 'Unpair Device' mode in order to remove the product from your Z-Wave system. Refer to the Controller's manual if you are unsure of how to perform this step.
  2. Make sure the product is powered. If not, plug it into a wall socket and power it on.
  3. Click Action Button 2 times quickly; it will bright violet light up to 2s.  
    a. If Removing fails, it will bright red light for 2 seconds and then turn back to Load Indicator Mode; repeat steps 1 to 3. Contact us for further support if needed.  
    b. If Removing succeeds, it will become breathing blue light. Smart Switch 7 is removed from the Z-Wave network successfully and is ready to be paired again.

Value 0 and 1 cannot be used at the same time, choose one as a part of your calculation.

Use the sum of values to determine what alarms trigger your Smart Switch 7.

For example:

Value = 0 + 256 + 512 + 1024 = 1792  
0 = sets the control scheme to turn on Smart Switch 7 when open alarm state happens

256 = allows Smoke Alarm signals to control SS7

512 = allows CO Alarm signals to control SS7

1024 = allows CO2 Alarm signals to control SS7This is an advanced parameter and will therefore not show in the user interface without entering advanced mode.
The following option values may be configured, in addition to values in the range 0 to 32513 -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Trigger open, disabled closed |
| 1 | Trigger closed, disabled open |
| 256 | Smoke alarm |
| 512 | CO Alarm |
| 1024 | CO2 Alarm |
| 2048 | Heat Alarm |
| 4096 | Water Alarm |
| 8192 | Access Control |
| 16384 | Home Security |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Trigger open, disabled closed).

Byte value = 0x**(Value 1)(Value 2)(Value 3)(Value 4)**

Suggestion - use a hexadecimal to decimal converter that can be easily found on google.

For example:

If you want to set Night Light Mode to be enabled at 19:00 at night and disable at 07:30 in the morning, you just need to configure:

Value1=0x13, Value2=0x00, Value3=0x07, Value4=0x1E.

Input 0x1300071E into a hexadecimal calculator, the output decimal value will be 318768926
Values in the range 0 to 0 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_82_4``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 91: Watt threshold

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <strong>Value</strong>
    </td>
    
    <td>
      <strong>Description</strong>
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
    </td>
    
    <td>
      Disable kWh threshold.
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      1 - 10000
    </td>
    
    <td>
      kWh threshold setting.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
Values in the range 0 to 10000 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```100```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_92_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 93: Current threshold

When to send a current report
If current passes the threshold setting by + or -, a current report will be sent to update its value.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <strong>Value</strong>
    </td>
    
    <td>
      <strong>Description</strong>
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
    </td>
    
    <td>
      Disable Current threshold.
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      1 - 100
    </td>
    
    <td>
      Current threshold setting by scale of 0.1A
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

If value 10 is set, this is the equivalent of setting threshold to 1.0A.
Values in the range 0 to 100 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_93_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 101: Timed report enable/disable

Configure timed report
Sets what sensors should be reported at a timed interval. This can be used at the same time as threshold reporting to allow both thresholds and timed reports to be used.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <strong>Value</strong>
    </td>
    
    <td>
      <strong>Description</strong>
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      1
    </td>
    
    <td>
      kWh (Accumulated Power)
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      2
    </td>
    
    <td>
      Watt (Power used at the time of the report)
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      4
    </td>
    
    <td>
      Current
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      8
    </td>
    
    <td>
      Voltage
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

The values in the table above should be added together. 

For example:

If you want kWh and Watt only, you would add 1 + 2 = 3.  
  
If you want all values (current, voltage, watt, kWh) reported at an interval, you would add 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 = 15.

If 0 is set to this parameter setting, this would completely disable timed reports. (Parameter 111 does not need to be set).
Values in the range 0 to 15 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_101_4``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 111: Timed report interval

  <tr>
    <td>
      Any value within 4 bytes.
    </td>
    
    <td>
      Reset Parameter Settings to default settings.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZW175 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Group 1

load notification type (lifeline)

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.
