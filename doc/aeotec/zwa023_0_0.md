The ZWA023 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

Switched power outlet with energy metering.

### Inclusion Information

Using your existing Z-Wave Controller supports Smart Start:

  1. Scan the QR code on Smart Switch using your Z-Wave gateway/controllers app.
  2. Plugin your Smart Switch to any outlet that you wish to install it on.
  3. Your Smart Switch will automatically pair to your Z-Wave network.

Using your existing Z-Wave Controller without Smart Start:

  1. Set your Z-Wave Controller into its 'Add Device' mode. Refer to the Controller's manual if you are unsure of how to perform this step.
  2. Power your Smart Switch to any outlet; its LED will slowly fade in and out slowly with a blue color to indicate it is ready to pair.
  3. Tap the action button once. The LED will rapidly flash when it enters pair mode.
  4. If your Z-Wave Controller supports S2 encryption, enter the first 5 digits of DSK into your Controller's interface if it is requested. The DSK is printed on Smart Switch.
      1. If pairing succeeds, it will become a bright blue light for 2 seconds.
      2. If pairing fails, it will light a solid bright red light for 2 seconds and then return to a breathing blue light; repeat steps 1 to 4 if this happens.

### Exclusion Information

  1. Set your Z-Wave Controller into 'Remove Device' / 'Unpair Device' mode. Refer to the Controller's manual if you are unsure of how to perform this step.
  2. Make sure the product is powered. If not, plug it into a wall socket and power it on.
  3. Click Action Button 2 times quickly; it will bright violet light up to 2s.
      1. If Removing fails, it will light a bright red color for 2 seconds and then turn back to Load Indicator Mode; repeat steps 1 to 3. Contact us for further support if needed.
      2. If Removing succeeds, it will become breathing blue light. Smart Switch is removed from the Z-Wave network successfully and is ready to be paired again.
