### Inclusion Information

<p&gt<strong&gtAdding your Range Extender into a Z-Wave network.</strong&gt</p&gt <p&gtGetting your Range Extender up and running is as simple as plugging it into a wall outlet and adding it to your Z-Wave network. There are 2 methods to pairing your Range Extender depending on the capabilities of your Z-Wave gateway/controller/hub.</p&gt <p&gt<strong&gtSmartStart Inclusion.</strong&gt</p&gt <p&gtYou can use this method of inclusion only if your Z-Wave gateway/controller/hub supports SmartStart.</p&gt <ol&gt<li&gtOpen up your Z-Wave gateway/controller/app.</li&gt <li&gtSelect SmartStart inclusion.</li&gt <li&gtScan the QR code located on the Range Extender 7.</li&gt <li&gtWithin 10 minutes after powering your Range Extender 7, it will automatically get included into your Z-Wave gateway/controller/hub.<br /&gt<br /&gtLED will flash for 1 second after Repeater is powered, if successful, the LED will become a solid bright light for 2 seconds.</li&gt </ol&gt<p&gt<strong&gtClassic Inclusion.</strong&gt</p&gt <ol&gt<li&gtDecide on where you want your Range Extender to be placed and then plug it into a wall outlet.   Make sure that the LED is breathing its white LED.</li&gt <li&gtSet your Z-Wave Controller into pairing mode.</li&gt <li&gtPress the Z-Wave Button on your Range Extender and quickly release the button (should only be a quick tap action on the button).<br /&gt<br /&gtRange Extender 7 will quickly flash its white LED up to 30 seconds or until it is paired successfully. If successfully paired, the LEDs light will become brighter.<br /&gt<br /&gtIf your repeater failed to pair, the LED will return to slow breathing LED. If it is this case, please return to step 2. <br /&gt<br /&gtIf you pairing with S2 encryption/security, enter the first 5 digits of the DSK into your controller/gateway/hub interface when requested.</li&gt </ol&gt<p&gtThe DSK is printed on the Range Extender 7 itself located right under the QR code. </p&gt

### Exclusion Information

<p&gt<strong&gtRemoving your Range Extender from a  Z-Wave network.</strong&gt</p&gt <p&gtYour Range Extender can be removed from your  Z-Wave network at any time. You’ll need to use your Z-Wave network’s main controller. To set your Z-Wave controller/gateway into removal mode, please refer to the respective section within your controller instruction manual.</p&gt <ol&gt<li&gtSet your Z-Wave Controller into device removal mode.</li&gt <li&gtPress the Z-Wave Button on your Range  Extender. </li&gt <li&gtIf Range Extender has been successfully removed from your network, its  LED will return to a slow breathing light.</li&gt </ol&gt

### General Usage Information

<p&gt<strong&gtGeneral LED Status</strong&gt</p&gt <p&gtThere are a few LED indications that you will need to pay attention to for the Range Extender 7.</p&gt <p&gt<strong&gtUnpaired from network.</strong&gt</p&gt <p&gtSlow breathing white LED</p&gt <p&gt<strong&gtWhile paired to an existing network.</strong&gt</p&gt <p&gtThe LED state is configurable, there are 2 states that you can choose, the LED will remain in a solid state as off or on:</p&gt <p&gtLED on.</p&gt <p&gtLED off.</p&gt <p&gt<strong&gtControl LED of Range Extender 7.</strong&gt</p&gt <p&gtYou can turn the LED on or off by using the action button of your Range Extender 7:</p&gt <ul&gt<li&gtTap the Action Button 2x times.</li&gt <li&gtLED should turn on or off each time you do so.</li&gt </ul&gt<p&gt<strong&gtTesting Health Connectivity.</strong&gt</p&gt <p&gt<strong&gtNOTE -</strong&gt This health detection function is only good for determining the direct connection to the gateway (within communication distance to your gateway without any other repeater nodes).</p&gt <p&gtYou can determine the health of your Range Extender 7 connectivity to your gateway using its manual button press, hold, and release function which is indicated by the LED.</p&gt <p&gtYou gateway/controller/hub must support displaying Z-Wave device health in order for you to see the health of your Range Extender 7 to your Z-Wave gateway.</p&gt <p&gtFollow these steps to test the health of your Range Extender to your Z-Wave gateway/controller/hub:</p&gt <ul&gt<li&gtPress and hold the Z-Wave Button for 5-10 seconds to test the communication health your Range Extender 7.  <ul&gt<li&gt@1 second, LED will turn off.</li&gt <li&gt@2 seconds, LED will breath its LED</li&gt <li&gt@5 seconds, LED will flash its LED</li&gt <li&gtRelease the Action Button to test the health. <br /&gt<br /&gtIf the LED sped up its flashing, you have held it for too long.</li&gt </ul&gt</li&gt </ul&gt<p&gtOnce the test is finished, the Range Extender 7 will forward a <strong&gtPower Level Report</strong&gt command to your Z-Wave gateway to display the communication quality. Some gateways do not support Power Level Command Class in its interface and may not show.</p&gt <p&gt<strong&gtManually resetting your Range Extender.</strong&gt</p&gt <p&gtIf at some stage, your primary controller is missing or inoperable, you may wish to reset all of your Range Extender’s settings to their factory defaults. </p&gt <p&gtMake sure to only do this if your Z-Wave gateway/controller/hub is non-functioning or missing.</p&gt <p&gtFollow these steps to factory reset:</p&gt <ul&gt<li&gtPress and hold the Z-Wave Button for 20 seconds to completely factory reset your Range Extender 7.  <ul&gt<li&gt@1 second, LED will turn off.</li&gt <li&gt@2 seconds, LED will breath its LED</li&gt <li&gt@5 seconds, LED will flash its LED</li&gt <li&gt@10 seconds, LED will speed up its flashing.</li&gt <li&gt@20 seconds, LED will become solid for 2 seconds, then start breathing its LED slowly to indicate it was factory reset.</li&gt <li&gtYou may now release the button.</li&gt </ul&gt</li&gt <li&gtIf successful, the LED should enter a slow breathing state to indicate it is ready to be paired to a new gateway/controller/hub.</li&gt </ul&gt

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the ZW189 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|



## Device Configuration

The device has no configuration parameters defined.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZW189 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Issue Device Reset Locally Notification when Factory Reset is performed.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.
