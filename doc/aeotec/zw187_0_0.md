Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

Aeotec Recessed Door Sensor (Gen 7) installs within a door's frame detecting the status of a door.

### Inclusion Information

**Add Recessed Door Sensor to your Z-Wave network.**

Getting your Recessed Door Sensor Gen7 up and running is as simple as powering it up, and adding it to your Z-Wave network. There are 2 methods to pairing your sensor depending on the capabilities of your Z-Wave gateway/controller/hub.

**SmartStart Inclusion.**

You can use this method of inclusion only if your Z-Wave gateway/controller/hub supports SmartStart.

  1. Open up your Z-Wave gateway/controller/hub app over your Smartphone.
  2. Select SmartStart inclusion.
  3. Scan the QR code located on Recessed Door Sensor Gen7.
  4. Once scanned, Recessed Door Sensor 7 will join your Z-Wave network automatically within 10 minutes from when it is powered up.

**Classic Inclusion.** 1. Decide on where you want your Recessed Door Sensor 7 to be placed. 

2.Set your Z-Wave Controller into pairing mode.

3. Press the Z-Wave Button on your Recessed Door Sensor 7 and quickly release the button (should only be a quick tap action on the button).  
  
Recessed Door Sensor 7 will quickly flash its red LED up to 30 seconds or until it is paired successfully. If successfully paired, the red LED will become solid for 10 seconds.

If your Recessed Door Sensor failed to pair, the LED will return to slow breathing LED. If it is this case, please return to step 2.

4. If you pairing with S2 encryption/security, enter the first 5 digits of the DSK into your controller/gateway/hub interface when requested.

When Recessed Door Sensor 7 successfully joins your Z-Wave network its LED will turn solid red for 10 seconds. If LED

becomes slow fade-in fade-out Red color before turning off, it means the device is still unable to join your Z-Wave

network; repeat the above steps and please contact us for further support if needed.

### Wakeup Information

The ZW187 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


**Wakeup your Recessed Door Sensor for configuration.**

You can wakeup Recessed Door Sensor 7 to communicate with your Z-Wave gateway or push configuration settings to your sensor.

To wake up your sensor, follow these steps:

  * Press and hold the Action Button for at least 2 seconds, but before 5 seconds. 
      * **@2 seconds**, LED will shows a slow pulsing LED 
          * Release action button here to toggle 10 minute wakeup.
          * If successful, LED will remain solid until sensor goes back to sleep.

### Door State
Indicates if the door/window is open or closed.

The ```sensor_door``` channel is of type ```sensor_door``` and supports the ```Contact``` item and is in the ```Door``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Contact``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OPEN | Open |
| CLOSED | Closed |

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZW187 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: On/Off Control


Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.
