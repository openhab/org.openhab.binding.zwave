The ZWA005 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The ZWA005 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

Aeotec TriSensor is a universal Z-Wave Plus compatible product, consists of temperature, lighting and motion sensors, powered by a CR123A battery. It can be included and operated in any Z-Wave network with other Z-Wave certified devices from other manufacturers and/or other applications. By the built-in motion sensor, an alarm will be sent to the gateway when the motion sensor is triggered.

### Inclusion Information

Press once TriSensor’s Action Button. If it is the first installation, the yellow LED will keep solid until whole network processing is complete. If successful, the LED will flash white -> green -> white -> green, after 2 seconds finished. If failed, the yellow LED lasts for 30 seconds, then the green LED flashes once. If it is the S2 encryption network, please enter the first 5 digits of DSK.

### Exclusion Information

Press once TriSensor’s Action Button, the Purple LED will keep solid until whole network processing is complete. If the exclusion is successful, the LED will flash white -> green - >white -> green and then LED will pulse a blue. If failed, the yellow LED lasts for 30 seconds, then the green LED flashes once.

### Wakeup Information

The ZWA005 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


Press and hold the button at least 2s until Red Led is on and then release the button,device will send wakeup notification to controller if device is in a Z-Wave network.

### General Usage Information

##  Factory reset

  1. Power up the device.
  2. Press and hold the button for 15s until Red Led is blinking,then release the button.

Note: Please use this procedure only when the network primary controller is missing or otherwise inoperable.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the ZWA005 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|

| Sensor (luminance) | sensor_luminance | sensor_luminance |  | Number | 
| Motion Alarm | alarm_motion | alarm_motion | Motion | Switch | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | system.battery_level | Battery | Number |

### Sensor (temperature)
Indicates the current temperature.

The ```sensor_temperature``` channel is of type ```sensor_temperature``` and supports the ```Number:Temperature``` item and is in the ```Temperature``` category.

### Sensor (luminance)
Indicates the current light reading.

The ```sensor_luminance``` channel is of type ```sensor_luminance``` and supports the ```Number``` item. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Motion Alarm
Indicates if a motion alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_motion``` channel is of type ```alarm_motion``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Motion``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.

### Parameter 100: Light Sensor Calibrated Coefficient

Calibration coefficient for light measurements
This configuration defines the calibrated scale for ambient light intensity. Because the method and position that the sensor mounted and the cover of sensor will bring measurement error, user can get more real light intensity by this parameter setting. User should run the steps as blows for calibrating:

  1. Set this parameter value to default (Assumes the sensor has been added in a Z- Wave Network).
  2. Place a digital luxmeter close to sensor and keep the same direction, monitor the light intensity value (Vm) which report to controller and record it. The same time user should record the value (Vs) of luxmeter.
  3. The scale calibration formula: k = Vm / Vs.
  4. The value of k is then multiplied by 1024 and rounded to the nearest whole number.
  5. Set the value getting in 5) to this parameter, calibrate finished.

For example, Vm = 300, Vs = 2600, then k = 2600 / 300 = 8.6667,  
k = 8.6667 * 1024 = 8874.7 ≈ 8875. In this case, the parameter should be set to 8875.
Values in the range 1 to 32767 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1024```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_100_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZWA005 supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Motion Alarm

Group 2 is controlling group, all nodes associated in this group will be controlled through BASIC_SET command by the device when device detects a movement event. Basic Set Value is decided by Configuration Parameter 6.

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Temperature Alarm

Group 3 is controlling group, all nodes associated in this group will be controlled through BASIC_SET command by the device when device detects a movement event. Basic Set Value is decided by Configuration Parameter 6.

Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.
