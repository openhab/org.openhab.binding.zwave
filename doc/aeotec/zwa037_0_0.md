# ZWA037 Aeotec Illumino Dimmer Switch
This describes the Z-Wave device *ZWA037*, manufactured by *Aeotec Limited* with the thing type UID of ```aeotec_zwa037_00_000```.

The device is in the category of *Wall Switch*, defining Any device attached to the wall that controls a binary status of something, for ex. a light switch.

![ZWA037 product image](https://opensmarthouse.org/zwavedatabase/1555/image/)


The ZWA037 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

This product can be operated in any Z-Wave™ network with other Z-Wave Plus™ certified devices from other manufacturers. All non-battery operated nodes within the network will act as repeaters regardless of vendor to increase reliability of the network. Each module is designed to act as a repeater, which will re-transmit a radio frequency (RF) signal by routing the signal around obstacles and radio dead spots to ensure that the signal is received at its intended destination. ZWA037-A is a security enabled Z-Wave Plus™ device. A security Enabled Z-Wave Plus™

Controller must be used in order to fully utilize the product.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZWA037 supports 8 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
