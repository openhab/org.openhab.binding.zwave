The ZWA045 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The ZWA045 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

Aeotec TriSensor 8 was developed to detect ambient values and movement and to transmit them with Z-Wave Plus. It is powered by Aeotec’s Gen8 technology.

Aeotec TriSensor is a universal Z-Wave Plus compatible product, consists of temperature, lighting and motion sensors, powered by a CR123A battery. It can be included and operated in any Z-Wave network with other Z-Wave certified devices from other manufacturers and/or other applications. By the built-in motion sensor, an alarm will be sent to the gateway when the motion sensor is triggered.

If it is the S2 encryption network, please enter the first 5 digits of DSK.

### Exclusion Information

Your TriSensor 8 can be removed from your Z-Wave network at any time. You'll need to use your Z-Wave network's main controller to do this and the following instructions tell you how to do this. If you are using other products as your main Z-Wave controller, please refer to the part of their respective manuals that tells you how to remove devices from your network. 

Using an existing gateway:

You may need to refer to your gateway's method of including devices if you do not know how to pair a Z-Wave device. You may use any gateway to perform an unpair/removal on TriSensor 8 even if they are not paired together to factory reset TriSensor 8.

1. Set your Z-Wave gateway into Z-Wave unpair (exclusion) mode.

Press once TriSensor’s Action Button. If it is the first installation, the yellow LED will keep solid until whole network processing is complete. If successful, the LED will flash white -> green -> white -> green, after 2 seconds finished. If failed, the yellow LED lasts for 30 seconds, then the green LED flashes once. If it is the S2 encryption network, please enter the first 5 digits of DSK.

### Wakeup Information

The ZWA045 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


In order to configure TriSensor 8, you must wake up TriSensor 8 using the below button press function. This section will go over the manual wakeup of this sensor in case you don't want to wait for configuration. 

Typically the TriSensor 8 will wake up automatically using the Wakeup command class, its default wakeup timeframe is once every 43200 seconds or once every 12 hours. 

Quick Wakeup.

1. Press and hold TriSensor 8 Action button for 3 seconds.

2. Wait until the LED flashes a blue color.

3. Release TriSensor 8 Action Button. 

Any queued commands in your Z-Wave Controller will be sent over. 

Press and hold the button at least 2s until Red Led is on and then release the button,device will send wakeup notification to controller if device is in a Z-Wave network.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_25_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZWA045 supports 7 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
General: Lifeline
Device Reset Locally:

When factory reset.

Notification Report:

See Notification Chapter for more information.

Sensor Multilevel Report:

When sensors above over limit or below under limit.

Battery Report:

Basic Set Command will be sent to the associated device when motion trigger or untrigger. The basic set value is determined by Param3. See Param4 for more information

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Over Heat
