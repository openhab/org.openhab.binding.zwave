| Parameter   | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| 1: Group 1 | Association Group 1 |
| 2: Group 2 | Association Group 2 |


#### 1: Group 1

Association Group 1  


##### Overview 

Association group one is intended for but not limited to controllers. All nodes whose Node ID that have been set in Association group one will receive all unsolicited Alarm Report frames, and Basic Report frames of 0x00 and 0xFF. Â When a sensor such as a door or window sensor is opened/faulted, the sensor will send a Basic Report to nodes in Association group one and a Basic Set of 0xFF to Association group two. When the door or window is closed the sensor will send a Basic Report of 0x00 to only group one.


| Property         | Value    |
|------------------|----------|
| Configuration ID | group_1 |
| Data Type        | TEXT |
