The 4SD2SZ-0EN0 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The 4SD2SZ-0EN0 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

Ring Alarm Contact Sensor is a wireless sensor for the Ring Alarm system which provides users the ability to know when a door or window is open or closed. After installing the sensor on a door or window and setting up the sensor in the Ring app, monitor and receive notifications when the door or window opens or closes.

### Inclusion Information

After powering on the device, press and hold the button on the front of the device for ~3 seconds.  


Release the button and the device will enter Classic inclusion mode which implements both classic inclusion with a Node Information Frame, and Network Wide Inclusion. 

During Classic Inclusion mode, the green LED will blink three times followed by a brief pause, repeatedly. When Classic inclusion times-out, the device will blink alternating red and green a few times.

LED Behaviour for Inclusion Blink Pattern

SmartStart Started Green LED three times, repeated after a brief pause

Classic Inclusion Started Green LED three times, repeated after a brief pause

Classic Inclusion Timed-Out Alternate red and green a few times

Inclusion Successful (Authenticated S2) Green LED on solid

Inclusion Not Successful (Self-Destruct) Red LED on solid

### Exclusion Information

 With the controller in Remove (Z-Wave Exclusion) mode, use a paper clip or similar object and tap the pinhole button. The device’s red LED turns on solid to indicate the device was removed from the network.

### Wakeup Information

The 4SD2SZ-0EN0 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.

### Parameter 2: Retries

Number of application level retries attempted for messages
Unsigned
Values in the range 0 to 5 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: App Level Retry Base Wait

The number base seconds used in the calculation for sleeping between retry messages.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1500```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_6_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The 4SD2SZ-0EN0 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Door/Window Open

1. Notification Report

a. See notification CC section for notifications that are sent

2. Battery Report
