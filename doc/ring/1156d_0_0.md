# Ring Motion Sensor
This describes the Z-Wave device *Ring*, manufactured by *Ring* with the thing type UID of ```ring_1156d_00_000```.

The device is in the category of *Motion Detector*, defining Motion sensors/detectors.

The Ring supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The Ring does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

Ring Alarm Motion Sensor: Expand your Ring Alarm system to secure each room in your home, and get alerts as soon as they detect motion.

### Inclusion Information

  1. Activate inclusion mode on controller
  2. Pull tab/quickly disconnect and reconnect battery
  3. Device should appear in Inbox

### Exclusion Information

  1. Initiate exclusion mode on controller
  2. Open contact sensor’s cover Remove and replace battery quickly

Reset:

  1. Press and hold the reset button found under the pinhole on the back of the device.
  2. The LED of the sensor should begin blinking. Hold the  button down until the blinking stops
  3. Remove the cover from your motion sensor.
  4. Remove the battery.
  5. Place the battery back in the device.
  6. Put the cover back on the device. 

### Wakeup Information

The Ring does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


By opening the cover, the sensor will get to tamper state and stay awake.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the Ring -:

| Channel | Channel Id | Category | Item Type |
|---------|------------|----------|-----------|
| Binary Sensor | sensor_binary | Door | Switch | 
| Alarm (burglar) | alarm_burglar | Door | Switch | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | Battery | Number |

### Binary Sensor

Indicates if a sensor has triggered.

The ```sensor_binary``` channel supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Door``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| ON | Triggered |
| OFF | Untriggered |

### Alarm (burglar)

Indicates if the burglar alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_burglar``` channel supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Door``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |

### Battery Level

Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```battery-level``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.



## Device Configuration

The device has no configuration parameters defined.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The Ring supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Controller Updates

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Basic Report

Basic Report
Basic Report

Association group 2 supports 1 node.
