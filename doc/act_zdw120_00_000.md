#### 1: Set Ignore Start Level Bit When Transmitting Dim Commands

Defines the behavior when transmitting dim commands  


##### Overview 

The ZDW120 can send Dim commands to Z-Wave enabled dimmers. The Dim command has a start level embedded in it. A dimmer receiving this command will start dimming from that start level. However, the command also has a bit that indicates whether the dimmer should ignore the start level. If the bit is set to 1, the dimmer will ignore the start level and instead start dimming from its current level. To clear this bit, configure this parameter to the value of 0.


| Property         | Value    |
|------------------|----------|
| Configuration ID | config_1_1 |
| Data Type        | INTEGER || Default Value | 1 |
| Options | Use transmisison start level (0) |
|  | Ignore transmisison start level (1) |


#### 2: Suspend Group 4

Disable transmission of command to Group 4  


##### Overview 

You may wish to disable transmitting commands to Z-Wave devices that are in Group 4 without “un-associating” those devices from the group. Setting parameter 2 to the value of 1 will stop the ZDW120 from transmitting to devices that are “associated” into Group 4.  
It is possible that you may only want the units in Group 4 to track when the dimmer is being turned ON and OFF and not when dimming.


| Property         | Value    |
|------------------|----------|
| Configuration ID | config_2_1 |
| Data Type        | INTEGER || Default Value | 0 |
| Options | Enable transmission to Group 4 (0) |
|  | Disable transmission to Group 4 (1) |


#### 3: Night Light

Defines the behavior of the blue LED.  


##### Overview 

Default is Night Light mode where LED is on when switch is off.


| Property         | Value    |
|------------------|----------|
| Configuration ID | config_3_1 |
| Data Type        | INTEGER || Default Value | 0 |
| Options | LED on when switch is OFF (0) |
|  | LED on when switch is ON (1) |


#### 4: Invert Switch

Change the top of the switch to OFF and the bottom of the switch to ON.  


##### Overview 

Note: If you invert the switches and also install the product upside down, remember the load will now be controlled by the right, not the left switch.


| Property         | Value    |
|------------------|----------|
| Configuration ID | config_4_1 |
| Data Type        | INTEGER || Default Value | 0 |
| Options | No (0) |
|  | Yes (1) |


#### 5: Ignore Start-Level (Receiving)

This dimmer will start dimming from its current level.


| Property         | Value    |
|------------------|----------|
| Configuration ID | config_5_1 |
| Data Type        | INTEGER || Default Value | 0 |
| Options | No (0) |
|  | Yes (1) |


#### 6: Don’t Send Level Command After Transmitting Dim Commands

Change behavior of dim level information update  


##### Overview 

When you press and hold the bottom of the ZDW120 paddle once, the Z-Wave devices that are associated into Group 1 are sent the Dim command. After you release the paddle, the ZDW120 follows up by commanding the devices to go to the same level of the ZDW120. By default, the ZDW120 is set not to do this. To enable ZDW120 to do this set this parameter to 0.


| Property         | Value    |
|------------------|----------|
| Configuration ID | config_6_1 |
| Data Type        | INTEGER || Default Value | 1 |
| Options | Send level command (0) |
|  | Don’t send level command (1) |


#### 7: On/Off Command Dim Step

Indicates how many levels the dimmer will change for each dimming step.


| Property         | Value    |
|------------------|----------|
| Configuration ID | config_7_1 |
| Data Type        | INTEGER |
| Range | 1 to 99 |
| Default Value | 1 |


#### 8: On/Off Command Dim Rate

Sets the rate at which the dimmer changes the light level.  


##### Overview 

This value indicates in 10 millisecond resolution, how often the dim level will change. For example, if you set this parameter to 1, then every 10ms the dim level will change. If you set it to 255, then every 2.55 seconds


| Property         | Value    |
|------------------|----------|
| Configuration ID | config_8_1 |
| Data Type        | INTEGER |
| Range | 1 to 255 |
| Default Value | 3 |


#### 9: Local Control Dim Step

| Configuration ID | config_9_1 |
| Data Type        | INTEGER |
| Range | 1 to 99 |
| Default Value | 1 |


#### 10: Local Control Dim Rate

Sets the dim rate  


##### Overview 

This value indicates in 10 millisecond resolution, how often the dim level will change. For example, if you set this parameter to 1, then every 10ms the dim level will change. If you set it to 255, then every 2.55 seconds the dimmer will change.


| Property         | Value    |
|------------------|----------|
| Configuration ID | config_10_1 |
| Data Type        | INTEGER |
| Range | 1 to 255 |
| Default Value | 3 |

| Configuration ID | config_11_1 |
| Data Type        | INTEGER |
| Range | 1 to 99 |
| Default Value | 1 |


#### 12: ALL ON/ALL OFF Dim Rate

Sets the dim rate for the all on/off command  


##### Overview 

This value indicates in 10 millisecond resolution, how often the dim level will change. For example, if you set this parameter to 1, then every 10ms the dim level will change. If you set it to 255, then every 2.55 seconds the dimmer will change.


| Property         | Value    |
|------------------|----------|
| Configuration ID | config_12_1 |
| Data Type        | INTEGER |
| Range | 1 to 255 |
| Default Value | 3 |


#### 13: Disable Group 4 During a Dim Command

Change behavior of command to Group 4 during Dim Command  


##### Overview 

After the ZDW120 is commanded to stop dimming, it will then command the Z-Wave devices in Group 4 to the ZDW120’s new level. To prevent the ZDW120 from commanding the Z-Wave devices in Group 4 during this particular occurrence, set Parameter 13 to the value of 1.

|  | Disable transmission to Group 4 (1) |


#### 19: LED Transmission Indication

Change behavior of LED during transmission to group 1-4  


##### Overview 

The ZDW120 will flicker its LED when it is transmitting to any of its 4 groups. This flickering can be set to not flicker at all (set to 0), to flicker the entire time it is transmitting (set to 1), or to flicker for only 1 second when it begins transmitting (set to 2). By default, the ZDW120 is set to flicker for only 1 second.
