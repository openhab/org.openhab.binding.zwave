The manufacturer defined default value is ```2```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: Number of Cool Stages / Heat Pump Stages



Values in the range 0 to 2 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```2```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 4: Heat Fuel Type

0=Fossil, 1=Electric

The following option values may be configured, in addition to values in the range 0 to 1 -:

| Value  | Description |

### Parameter 5: Calibration Temperature

-10°F to 10°F, 1°F increments

Values in the range -10 to 10 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_5_4``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 6: Swing

0°F to 3°F, 0.5°F increments
Swing determines how far from the setpoint the temperature is before the thermostat will turn heat/cooling on or off.
Values in the range 0 to 6 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_6_0``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ADC-T3000 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 4 nodes.
