The ADC-T 2000 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

  * Intelligently Connected with Alarm.com (Alarm.com account required) 
  * Remote Access and Control 
  * Custom Schedules 
  * Critical Temperature Alerts and Geo-Services Automation 
  * Can be paired with Alarm.com Temperature Sensor ADC-S2000-T-RA for enhanced climate control and improved energy savings (sold separately)

### Inclusion Information

Put thermostat in OFF mode (no mode icons are lit)

Press and hold the DOWN button to begin inclusion mode. Release when the RADIO icon lights up.

When the RADIO icon becomes solid, the thermostat has been included.

### Exclusion Information

Put thermostat in OFF mode (no mode icons are lit)

Press and hold the DOWN button to begin exclusion mode. Release when the RADIO icon lights up.

When the RADIO icon flashes red, the thermostat has been excluded.

### Wakeup Information

The ADC-T 2000 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the ADC-T 2000 -:

| Channel | Channel Id | Category | Item Type |
|---------|------------|----------|-----------|
| Sensor (temperature) | sensor_temperature | Temperature | Number:Temperature | 
| Sensor (relative humidity) | sensor_relhumidity | Humidity | Number | 
| Thermostat mode | thermostat_mode | Temperature | Number | 
| Operating State | thermostat_state | Temperature | Number | 
| Setpoint (heating) | thermostat_setpoint | Temperature | Number:Temperature | 
| Setpoint (cooling) | thermostat_setpoint | Temperature | Number:Temperature | 
| Thermostat fan mode | thermostat_fanmode |  |  | 
| Thermostat fan state | thermostat_fanstate |  |  | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | Battery | Number |
| Clock Time Offset | time_offset | Temperature | Number | 

### Sensor (temperature)

Indicates the current temperature.

The ```sensor_temperature``` channel supports the ```Number:Temperature``` item and is in the ```Temperature``` category.

### Sensor (relative humidity)

Indicates the current relative humidity.

The ```sensor_relhumidity``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Humidity``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Thermostat mode

Sets the thermostat.

The ```thermostat_mode``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Temperature``` category.
The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Number``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| 0 | Off |
| 1 | Heat |
| 2 | Cool |
| 3 | Auto |
| 4 | Aux Heat |
| 5 | Resume |
| 6 | Fan Only |
| 7 | Furnace |
| 8 | Dry Air |
| 9 | Moist Air |
| 10 | Auto Changeover |
| 11 | Heat Economy |
| 12 | Cool Economy |
| 13 | Away |

### Operating State

Sets the thermostat operating state.

The ```thermostat_state``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Temperature``` category.
The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Number``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| 0 | Idle |
| 1 | Heating |
| 2 | Cooling |
| 3 | Fan Only |

Sets the thermostat setpoint.

The ```thermostat_setpoint``` channel supports the ```Number:Temperature``` item and is in the ```Temperature``` category.

### Setpoint (cooling)

Sets the thermostat setpoint.

The ```thermostat_setpoint``` channel supports the ```Number:Temperature``` item and is in the ```Temperature``` category.

### Thermostat fan mode

Channel type information on this channel is not found.

### Thermostat fan state

Channel type information on this channel is not found.

### Battery Level

Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```battery-level``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.

### Clock Time Offset

Provides the current time difference for the devices time.

The ```time_offset``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Temperature``` category.



## Device Configuration

The device has no configuration parameters defined.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The device does not support associations.
