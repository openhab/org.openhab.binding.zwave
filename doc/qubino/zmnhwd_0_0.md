The ZMNHWD supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

Qubino Flush RGBW module controls RGB/RGBW strips and LED strips or bulbs and has 5 special scene effects. It can also control halogen lights and fans. Its extremely small size allows for easy installation behind wall sockets and switches. Controlled devices may be powered by 12 or 24 VDC.

Supported control types:

  * Push button (monostable switch)
  * Bistable switch

This should hopefully work with models ZMNHWD1-ZMNHWD8 (which work on different frequencies).

### Inclusion Information

To include the device, press the service button 3 times within 2 seconds. The LED will turn green if the device was properly included.

The device supports auto inclusion: Install the device and connect the power. The auto inclusion function will be active for about 2 minutes.

### Exclusion Information

To exclude the device, press the service button 3 times within 2 seconds. The green LED will blink if the device was properly included and the device will be reset to factory defaults.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZMNHWD supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Send basic report to this group

The Module can be set 1 auto-report ID in Group 1.

The Module will send BASIC_REPORT to device associated in Group 1 when correspond Device is activated.

Association group 1 supports 1 node.
