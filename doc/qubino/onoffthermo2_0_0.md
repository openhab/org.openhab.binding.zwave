The Qubino Flush On/Off Thermostat 2 is ideal for remotely controlling electric or water-based underfloor heating systems, electric water heaters, hot water pumps, electric radiators and similar.

### Inclusion Information

Classic Inclusion

AUTOMATICALLY ADDING THE DEVICE TO A Z-WAVE NETWORK (SMARTSTART INCLUSION)

  1. Scan QR code on device label and add S2 DSK to Provisioning List in gateway (hub)
  2. Connect the device to the power supply (with the temperature sensor already connected).
  3. Inclusion will be initiated automatically within few seconds of connection to the power supply and the device will automatically enrol in your network (when the device is excluded and connected to the power supply it automatically enters the LEARN MODE state).

**NOTE: LEARN MODE state allows the device to receive network information from the controller.**

ⓘ SmartStart inclusion is a part of S2 security level, so if you want to use SmartStart, you need to include it as S2 Authenticated. 

MANUALLY ADDING THE DEVICE TO A Z-WAVE NETWORK (MANUAL INCLUSION)

  1. Enable add/remove mode on your Z-Wave gateway (hub) 
  2. Connect the device to the power supply (with the temperature sensor already connected*) 
  3. Toggle the switch connected to the I1 terminal 3 times within 3 seconds (The device has to get On/Off signal 3 times, meaning 3 times click on the push button or with the normal button 3 times On/Off.) (this procedure puts the device in LEARN MODE) in the first minute after power cycle.

OR

If the device is powered by 24 V SELV supply, press and hold the S (Service) button between 3 and 6 seconds (this procedure puts the device in LEARN MODE)

  1. A new device will appear on your dashboard
  2. Inclusion with the switch connected to I1 terminal is not limited by time

*If connecting the temperature sensor, switch off the power supply.

**NOTE1: LEARN MODE state allows the device to receive network information from the controller.**

### Exclusion Information

Classic Exclusion

REMOVAL FROM A ZWAVE NETWORK (Z-WAVE EXCLUSION)

  1. Connect the device to the power supply
  2. Make sure the device is within direct range of your Z-Wave gateway (hub) or use a hand-held Z-Wave remote to perform exclusion 
  3. Enable add/remove mode on your Z-Wave gateway (hub)
  4. Toggle the switch connected to the I1 terminal 3 times within 3 seconds in the first minute after power cycle (The device has to get On/Off signal 3 times, meaning 3 times click on the push button or with the normal button 3 times On/Off). 

OR

If the device is powered by 24 V SELV supply, press and hold the S (Service) button between 3 and 6 seconds

  1. Exclusion with the switch connected to I1 terminal is not limited by time 
  2. The device will be removed from your network, but any custom configuration parameters will not be erased

**NOTE1: LEARN MODE state allows the device to receive network information from the controller.**

**NOTE2: After device is excluded you should wait 30 seconds before performing re-inclusion.**

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZMNKID supports 4 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Supports the following commands:

• Device Reset Locally: triggered upon request,

• Sensor multilevel report: triggered upon temperature change,

• Meter report: triggered upon energy consumption change according to configuration parameters 40, 42,

• Notification report: triggered upon current overload detection,

• Thermostat mode: triggered upon thermostat mode change

• Thermostat operating state: triggered upon thermostat operating state (Idle, Heating, Cooling)

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Change of output Q

Supports the following command:

• Basic set: triggered by change of output Q

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Basic on/off too high too low T

Supports the following command:

• Basic set: triggered when actual temperature reaches Too High or Too Low temperature limit;

Heat mode: when temperature reaches Too High Temperature Limit reports OFF (0x00), when temperature reaches Too Low Temperature Limit reports ON (0xFF).

Cool mode: when temperature reaches Too High Temperature Limit reports ON (0xFF), when temperature reaches Too Low Temperature Limit reports OFF (0x00).

Thermostat off mode reports OFF (0x00) on both limits reached.

Hysteresis is 1°C.

Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 4: Sensor multilevel report

Supports the following command:

• Sensor multilevel report: triggered by change of temperature for threshold defined in configuration parameter 120

Association group 4 supports 5 nodes.
