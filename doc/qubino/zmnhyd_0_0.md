## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZMNHYD supports 5 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Reserved for communication with main controller

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Status on/off

Send control command BASIC_SET 0x00/0xFF
This group is assigned to the Smart Plug status On/Off. It allows sending the control command BASIC_SET 0x00/0xFF to associated devices whenevert the Smart Plug is turned On or Off.

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Load dependent 

sending control commands BASIC_SET 0x00/0xFF depending on current load
This groups allows to send control commands BASIC_SET 0x00/0xFF to associated devices depending on the current load. This association group is configured through the parameters no. 50, 51 and 52.

Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 4: Secure Status On/Off

Send control command BASIC_SET 0x00/0xFF
This group is equivalent to association group 2, except commands are sent securily encapsulated.

Association group 4 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 5: Secure Load dependent 

sending control commands BASIC_SET 0x00/0xFF depending on current load
This group is equivalent to association group 3, except commands are sent securily encapsulated.

Association group 5 supports 5 nodes.
