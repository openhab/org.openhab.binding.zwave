### General Usage Information

**Installation**

Before installing the device, please read the following carefully and follow the instructions exactly:

**Danger of electrocution!**

Installation of this device requires a great degree of skill and may be performed only by a licensed and qualified electrician. Please keep in mind that even when the device is turned off, voltage may still be present in the device’s terminals.

**Note!**

Do not connect the device to loads exceeding the recommended values. Connect the device exactly as shown in the provided diagrams. Improper wiring may be dangerous and result in equipment damage.

Electrical installation must be protected by directly associated overcurrent protection fuse with rated current up to 65A, it must be used according to wiring diagram to achieve appropriate overload protection of the device.  
  
The installation process, tested and approved by professional electricians, consists of the following simple steps:

  * Step 1 – Turn OFF the fuse:  
    To prevent electrical shock and/or equipment damage, disconnect electrical power at the main fuse or circuit breaker before installation and maintenance.  
    Be aware that even if the circuit breaker is off, some voltage may remain in the wires — before proceeding with the installation, be sure no voltage is present in the wiring.  
    Take extra precautions to avoid accidentally turning the device on during installation.
  * Step 2 – Installing the device:  
    Connect the device exactly according to the diagrams shown below

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_112_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZMNHXD supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Lifeline group (reserved for communication with the gateway (hub))

Association group 1 supports 1 node.
