The ZMNHHD supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

Mini Dimmer is a MOSFET-switching light device that also supports control of low-voltage halogen lamps with electronic transformers, dimmable compact fluorescent lights, and dimmable LED bulbs. It measures power consumption of the connected device. It supports push-button/momentary switches (default) and toggle switches. It can work with or without the neutral line. Qubino Mini Dimmer allows the easiest and quickest installation. It is designed to be mounted inside a “flush mounting box”, hidden behind a traditional wall switch. It acts as repeater in order to improve range and stability of Z-Wave network.

### Inclusion Information

Inclusion

AUTOMATICALLY ADDING THE DEVICE TO A Z-WAVE NETWORK (AUTO INCLUSION)

  1. Enable add/remove mode on your Z-Wave gateway (hub)
  2. Automatic selection of secure/unsecure inclusion.
  3. The device can be automatically added to a Z-Wave network during the first 2 minutes
  4. Connect the device to the power supply
  5. Auto-inclusion will be initiated within 5 seconds of connection to the power supply and the device will automatically enrol in your network. 

(when the device is excluded and connected to the power supply it automatically eneters the LEARN MODE state.)

**NOTE: LEARN MODE state allows the device to receive network infromation from the controller**

**NOTE: Please wait at least 30 seconds between each inclusion and exclusion.**

MANUALLY ADDING THE DEVICE TO A Z-WAVE NETWORK (MANUAL INCLUSION)

  1. Connect the device to the power supply
  2. Enable add/remove mode on your Z-Wave gateway (hub)
  3. Toggle the switch connected to the I1 terminal 3 times within 3 seconds (this procedure put the device in LEARN MODE)

OR

Press and hold the S (Service) button between 2 and 6 seconds if connected to 24-30VDC (this procedure put the device in LEARN MODE)

4. A new device will appear on your dashboard

**NOTE: LEARN MODE state allows the device to receive network infromation from the conttoller **

**NOTE: Please wait at least 30 seconds between each inclusion and exclusion.**

Mini Dimmer supports the latest Security 2 feature. When adding the Mini Dimmer to a Z-Wave network with a controller supporting Security 2 (S2), the PIN code of the Z-Wave Device Specific Key (DSK) is required. The unique DSK code is printed on the product label and a copy is inserted in the packaging, which must not be lost. Do not remove the DSK from the product. As a backup measure, use the label in the packaging. The first five digits of the key are highlighted or underlined to help the user identify the PIN code portion of the DSK text.

### Exclusion Information

Exclusion

REMOVAL FROM A Z-WAVE NETWORK (Z-WAVE EXCLUSION)

  1. Connect the device to the power supply
  2. Make sure the device is within direct range of your Z-Wave gateway (hub) or use a hand-held Z-Wave remote to perform exclusion
  3. Enable add/remove mode on your Z-Wave gateway (hub)
  4. Toggle the switch connected to the I1 terminal 3 times within 3 seconds (this procedure put the device in LEARN MODE)

OR

Press and hold the S (Service) button between 2 and 6 seconds if connected to 24-30VDC (this procedure put the device in LEARN MODE)

  1. The device will be removed from your network, but any custom configuration parameters will not be erased

**NOTE: LEARN MODE state allows the device to receive network infromation from the conttoller **

**NOTE: Please wait at least 30 seconds between each inclusion and exclusion.**

### General Usage Information

**FACTORY RESET**

  1. Connect the device to the power supply.
  2. Within the first minute (60seconds) the device is connected to the power supply, toggle the switch connected to the I1 terminal 5 times within 3 seconds.

OR

Press and hold the S (Service) button for at least 6 seconds if connected to 24-30VDC.

**NOTE:** By resetting the device, all custom parameters previously set on the device will return to their default values, and the node ID will be deleted. Use this reset procedure only when the main gateway (hub) is missing or otherwise inoperable.

**NOTE:** the reset with switch connected to I1 is possible only in the first minute after the device is connected to the power.

**NOTE:** after the reset is successfully done the autocalibration will trigger and the green LED will start blinking.

**LED SIGNALIZATION FOR INCLUSION/EXCLUSION**

LED (green)

  * LED is blinking (1 sec ON, 1 sec OFF) = module is excluded
  * LED is ON = module is included

LED (red)

  * LED is OFF = normal operation
  * LED is ON = overload
  * LED is blinking (1 sec ON, 1 sec OFF) = over temperature

LED (blue)

  * LED is OFF = normal operation
  * LED is blinking (1 sec ON, 1 sec OFF) = calibration in progress
  * LED is ON = calibration failed

**NOTE:** After each power cycle all 3 LEDs will blink once before resuming normal operation.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZMNHHD supports 4 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Lifeline


Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Basic OnOff

Basic OnOff
Supports the following command classes:

• Basic set: triggered at change of output and reflecting its state

Association group 2 supports 16 nodes.

### Group 3: StartStop level change

StartStop level change
Supports the following command classes:

• Start/Stop Level Change: triggered upon holding and releasing the switch connected to I1

**NOTE: Association 3 StartStop level change is switch type dependant. The switch must be a bi-stable switch type otherwise the association can not be trigered. To know how to change the switch type connected, please refer to chapter "Configuration parameters", in the official manual, for more information.**

**NOTE: When the device is in switch mode (parameter 5 set to 1), this association group is**** not available. **

Association group 3 supports 16 nodes.

### Group 4: Multilevel set

Multilevel set
Supports the following command classes:

• Switch Multilevel Set: triggered at change of output and reflecting its state

**NOTE: When the device is in switch mode (parameter 5 set to 1), this association group is not available. **

Association group 4 supports 16 nodes.
