The ZMNHUD supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

The ZMNHUD is used to control electric Radiators with 6 different working modes by pilot wire control signal. The module can be controlled either through a Z-Wave network or through the wall switch.  
The module is designed to be mounted inside an electrical cabinet onto DIN rail.

### Inclusion Information

Press the S button for 2 seconds

### Exclusion Information

Press the S button for 6 seconds

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the ZMNHUD -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |

| Dimmer | switch_dimmer | switch_dimmer | DimmableLight | Dimmer | 
| Binary Sensor | sensor_binary | sensor_binary |  | Switch | 

### Dimmer
The brightness channel allows to control the brightness of a light.
            It is also possible to switch the light on and off.

The ```switch_dimmer``` channel is of type ```switch_dimmer``` and supports the ```Dimmer``` item and is in the ```DimmableLight``` category.

### Binary Sensor
Indicates if a sensor has triggered.

The ```sensor_binary``` channel is of type ```sensor_binary``` and supports the ```Switch``` item. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZMNHUD supports 5 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Reserved for communication with the main controller

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Multilevel

Triggered at changes of state/value of the Flush pilot wire

Association group 2 supports 99 nodes.

### Group 3: Basic on/off - input I1

Triggered at change of the input I1 state and reflecting its state

Association group 3 supports 99 nodes.

### Group 4: Basic on/off -  input I2

Triggered at change of the input I2 state and reflecting its state

Association group 4 supports 99 nodes.

### Group 5: Basic on/off - input I3

Triggered at change of the input I3 state and reflecting its state

Association group 5 supports 99 nodes.
