The ZMNHAA supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

This Z-Wave module is used for switching on or off the electrical device (e.g. light, fan, etc ...). The module can be controlled either through Z-wave network or through the wall switch.

### Inclusion Information

  * press service button S for more than 2 second or
  * press push button I1 three times within 3s (3 times change switch state within 3 seconds).

### Exclusion Information

  * press service button S for more than 6 second or
  * press push button I1 five times within 3s (5 times change switch state within 3 seconds) in the first 60 seconds after the module is connected to the power supply.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZMNHAA supports 4 association groups.

### Group 1: basic on/off 

triggered at change of the output Q state and reflecting its state
e

Association group 1 supports 16 nodes.

### Group 2:  basic on/off -  input I2

(triggered at change of the input I2 state and reflecting its state)

Association group 2 supports 16 nodes.

### Group 3:  basic on/off -  input I3

ttriggered at change of the input I3 state and reflecting its state)

Association group 3 supports 16 nodes.

### Group 4: Controller Updates


Association group 4 supports 1 node.
