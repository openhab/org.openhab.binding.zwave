The ZMNHZD supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

Weather Station is used for measuring temperature, humidity, wind & rain properties and sending the measurement values to your Z-Wave network.The Weather Station can measure 10 different values: two sets of temperature/humidity sensors, wing gauge with 5 sensors (direction, velocity, wind gust, temperature and wind chill) and a rain sensor. With the use of the included Weather Station USB KEY all 10 values (end points) are sent and rendered in your home Z-Wave network. Qubino Weather Station Key is used for receiving Wireless data packages (from Thermo/ Hygro Sensor Ch1, Thermo/ Hygro Sensor Ch2, Rain Gauge, Wind Gauge) and sends it to the Z-Wave Controller. The Key is designed to be plugged into the USB Power Adapter. Module receives data for Temperature, Wind Chill, Velocity, Wind Gust, Wind Direction, Humidity, Rain Rate and Battery Level for each Sensor. It is designed to act as repeater in order to improve range and stability of Z-wave network.

Remote Weather Sensors The remote weather sensors include a thermo-hygrometer, anemometer (wind sensor) and rain sensor. All data collected by the sensors are transmitted to the Weather Station Key by wireless RF, with a range up to 100 meters (open area). The Weather station Key supports a maximum of 2 thermo-hygrometers, allowing 2 channels of temperature/humidity display (Ch1 and Ch2)

The Weather Station Key supports both, the secure and unsecure inclusion. Even if the controller does not support security command classes, the Key could be included as unsecure and keep all the functionality. By default, the Key includes as unsecure. To include the Key as secure follow the procedure:

  1. Include the Key into the controller
  2. Set the parameter 250 to the value “1”
  3. Enable add/remove mode on main controller,
  4. Hold service button S between 1.5 and 4 seconds to exclude the module
  5. If the exclusion of the module was successful, the LED on the module starts blinking
  6. Unplug the module out of the power supply
  7. enable add/remove mode on main controller
  8. Plug the module into the power supply to star autoinclusion
  9. Now the module should be included as secure

The same procedure is to include the module as unsecure
Values in the range 0 to 1 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_250_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZMNHZD supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Reserved for the communication with the main controller

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Basic on/off - wind

triggered when the wind gust of the wind gauge exceed the configuration parameter 1 value

Association group 2 supports 16 nodes.

### Group 3: Basic on/off - rain

triggered when the rain rate exceed the configuration parameter 2 value

Association group 3 supports 16 nodes.
