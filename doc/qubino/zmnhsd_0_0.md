The ZMNHSD supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

This Z-wave module is used for dimming the bulb or to manage the speed of a fan. The module can be controlled either thorough Z-wave network or through the wall switch.

The module is designed to be mounted inside an electrical cabinet onto DIN rail.

Module measures power consumption of bulb or fan and supports connection of digital temperature sensor. It is designed to act as repeater in order to improve range and stability of Z-wave network.

### Inclusion Information

Press service button S for more than 6 seconds or press push button I five times within 3s (5 times change switch state within 3 seconds) in the first 60 seconds after the module is connected to the power supply

### Exclusion Information

If service button S is pressed more than 2 and less than 6 seconds (or if push button I is pressed three times within 3s) module is excluded, but configuration parametres are not set to default values.

Note: If the module is included with parameter 5 with value different from default and module reset is done, wait at least 30s before next inclusion
