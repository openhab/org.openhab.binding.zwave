The ZMNHAD supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

This Z-Wave module is used for switching on or off the electrical device (e.g. light or fan). The module can be controlled either through Z-wave network or through the wall switch. The module is designed to be mounted inside a “flush mounting box”, hidden behind a traditional wall switch. Module measures power consumption of electrical device and supports connection of digital temperature sensor. It is designed to act as repeater in order to improve range and stability of Z-wave network. Supported switches Module supports mono-stable switches (push button) and bi-stable switches. The module is factory set to operate with bi-stable switches.

### Inclusion Information

**Module Inclusion (Adding to Z-Wave network)**

  * Connect module to power supply (with temperature sensor connected -if purchased)
  * Enable add/remove mode on main controller
  * Auto-inclusion (works forabout 5 seconds after connected to power supply) or
  * Press push button I1 three times within 3s (3 times change switch state within 3 seconds) or
  * Press service button **S** (only applicable for 24 V SELV supply voltage) for more than 2 seconds.

**NOTE1:** For auto-inclusion procedure, first set main controller into inclusion mode and then connect module to power supply.

**NOTE2:** When connecting temperature sensor to module that has already been included, you have to exclude module first. Switch off power supply , connect the sensor and re-include the module.

### Exclusion Information

**Module Exclusion/Reset (Removing from Z-Wavenetwork)**

  * Connect module to power supply
  * Bring module within maximum 1 meter (3 feet) of the main controller,
  * Enable add/remove mode on main controller,
  * Press push button **I1 **five times within 3s (5 times change switch state within 3 seconds) in the first 60 seconds after the module is connected to the power supply or
  * Press service button **S **(only applicable for 24 V SELV supply voltage) for more than 6 seconds.

By this function all parameters of the module are set to default values and own ID is deleted.

If push button I1 is pressed three times within 3s (or service button S is pressed more than 2 and less than 6 seconds) module is excluded, but configuration parameters are not set to default values.

### General Usage Information

Note regarding the temperatur channels:

  * Temperature sensor connected (device becomes multi channel, temperature reports are sent from endpoint2, if multi channel lifeline is enabled)
  * I2 enabled via parameter 100, temperature sensor connected and reinclusion is performed (device becomes multi channel, temperature is sent from endpoint3)
  * I2 and I3 enabled via parameters 100 and 101, temeprature sensor connected and reinclusion is performed (device becomes multi channel, temperature is sent from endpoint4)

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZMNHAD supports 9 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Lifeline group (reserved for communication with the main controller)

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Basic on/off (triggered input Q state)

basic on/off (triggered at change of the output Q state and reflecting its state) up to 16 nodes.

Association group 2 supports 16 nodes.

### Group 3: Basic on/off (triggered input I2 state)

 basic on/off (triggered at change of the input I2 state and reflecting its state) up to 16 nodes.

Association group 3 supports 16 nodes.

### Group 4: Notification report (triggered  input I2 state)

Notification report (triggered at change of the input I2 state and reflecting its state) up to 16 nodes.

Association group 4 supports 16 nodes.

### Group 5: Binary Sensor (triggered  input I2 state)

 Binary sensor (triggered at change of the input I2 state and reflecting its state) up to 16 nodes.

Association group 5 supports 16 nodes.

### Group 6: Basic on/off (triggered input I3 state)

 basic on/off (triggered at change of the input I3 state and reflecting its state) up to 16 nodes

Association group 6 supports 16 nodes.

### Group 7: Notification report (triggered input I3 state)

notification report (triggered at change of the input I3 state and reflecting its state) up to 16 nodes.

Association group 7 supports 16 nodes.

### Group 8: Binary Sensor report (triggered  input I3 state)
