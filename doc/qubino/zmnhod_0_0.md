Triggered at change of the input I1 state and reflecting its state

Association group 2 supports 16 nodes.

### Group 3: Basic on/off - input I2

Triggered at change of the input I2 state and reflecting its state

Association group 3 supports 16 nodes.

### Group 4: Basic on/off - direction of roller

Triggered at sensing moving direction of roller
up=FF, down=0

Association group 4 supports 16 nodes.

### Group 5: Basic on/off - roller position

Triggered at reaching roller position
bottom=FF, top=0

Association group 5 supports 16 nodes.

### Group 6: Basic on/off

Triggered at reaching roller position
bottom=FF, not bottom=0

Association group 6 supports 16 nodes.

### Group 7:  Multilevel set

triggered at changes of value of the Flush Shutter DC position

Association group 7 supports 16 nodes.

### Group 8: Multilevel set
