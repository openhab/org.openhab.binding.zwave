The ZMNKAD supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

The Qubino LUXY Smart Switch is ideal for gentle illumination of any room, for visual and sound notifications, and for controlling various loads, using the built-in relay.

### Inclusion Information

Manual inclusion is triggered by the following procedure: 

  * Full white needs to be active (c-button 2). The user can select it by quickly pressing the c-button2 once.
  * When full white is enabled, press c-button3 and hold it for 5 seconds (while white is glowing, hold c-button3 for 5 seconds).
  * After 5 seconds, the device starts flashing, with the following pattern: green 1 second on, 0.5 second off.
  * Once the device receives a nodeId or after 10 seconds, it stops flashing and turns green. 

### Exclusion Information

Exclusion is triggered by the following procedure:

  * Full white needs to be active (c-button 2).
  * When full white is enabled, press c-button3 and hold it for 5 seconds (while white is glowing hold c-button3 for 5 seconds).
  * After 5 seconds, the device starts flashing with the following pattern: red 1 second on, 0.5 second off. 
  * Once the device loses its nodeId or after 10 seconds, it stops flashing and turns red.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZMNKAD supports 5 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
