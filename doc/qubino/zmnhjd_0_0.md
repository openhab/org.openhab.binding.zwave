The ZMNHJD supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

This Z-Wave module is used to control electric Radiators with 6 different working modes by pilot wire control signal. The module can be controlled either through a Z-Wave network or through the wall switch.

### Inclusion Information

  * press service button S for more than 2 second or
  * press push button I1 three times within 3s (3 times change switch state within 3 seconds). 

### Exclusion Information

  * press service button S for more than 6 second or
  * press push button I1 five times within 3s ( 5 times change switch state within 3 seconds) in the first 60 seconds after the module is connected to the power supply.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZMNHJD supports 5 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Reserved for communication with the main controller

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Multilevel

Triggered at changes of state/value of the Flush pilot wire

Association group 2 supports 99 nodes.

### Group 3: Basic on/off 

Triggered at change of the input I1 state and reflecting its state

Association group 3 supports 99 nodes.

### Group 4: Basic on/off - input I2

Triggered at change of the input I2 state and reflecting its state

Association group 4 supports 99 nodes.

### Group 5: Basic on/off -  input I3

Triggered at change of the input I3 state and reflecting its state

Association group 5 supports 99 nodes.
