# ZTM230 Dual paddle wall mounted transmitter

This describes the Z-Wave device *ZTM230*, manufactured by *ACT - Advanced Control Technologies* with the thing type UID of ```act_ztm230_00_000```. 

Dual paddle wall mounted transmitter  


## Overview 

The ZTM230 Wall Mounted Transmitter is a component of the HomePro lighting control system. Wire the Transmitter anywhere power is available according to the diagram above and program from the Wireless Controller to operate loads. Inclusion of the ZTM230 Wall Mounted Transmitter on the ZTH200 Wireless Controller menu allows remote ON/OFF control and dimming of lights controlled by associated modules, as it does not control any electrical load directly.

This Wall Mounted Transmitter is designed to work with other Z-Wave enabled devices. Z-Wave nodes of other types can be Included in the network and will also act as repeaters to increase the range of the network.  

  


### Inclusion Information 

Including to the Network (Must be installed in its permanent location, not on test bench)  
1. Setup the controller you are using to include the device into the network.  
2. Tap the top or bottom of the left switch once  

  


### Exclusion Information 

1. Setup the controller you are using to exclude a device from the network.  
2. Tap the top or the bottom of the left switch once.

#### 1: Ignore Start Level Bit

Set Ignore Start Level Bit When Transmitting Dim Commands  


##### Overview 

The ZTM230 can send Dim commands to Z-Wave enabled dimmers. The Dim command has a start level embedded in it. A dimmer receiving this command will start dimming from that start level. However, the command can be sent so that the dimmer ignores the start level and instead start dimming from its current level. By default, the ZTM230 sends the command so that the dimmer will start dimming from its current dim level rather then the start level embedded in the command. To change this, simply set the configuration parameter above to 0.  


| Property         | Value    |
|------------------|----------|
| Configuration ID | config_1_1 |
| Data Type        | INTEGER || Default Value | 1 |
| Options | Do not ignore start level (0) |
|  | Ignore start level (1) |


#### 2: Suspend Group 4

Disable transmitting commands to group 4 devices.  


##### Overview 

You may wish to disable transmitting commands to Z-Wave devices that are in Group 4 without “disassociating” those devices from the group.  
Setting parameter 2 to the value of 1 will stop the ZTM230 from transmitting to devices that are “associated” into Group 4  


| Property         | Value    |
|------------------|----------|
| Configuration ID | config_2_1 |
| Data Type        | INTEGER |
| Range | 0 to 1 |
| Default Value | 0 |


#### 3: Night Light

LED behaviour of the ZTM230.  


##### Overview 

The LED on the ZTM230, will by default, turn ON when the status of the devices in Group 1 is ON. To make the LED turn ON when the status of Group 1 is OFF set this parameter to a value of 1.  


| Property         | Value    |
|------------------|----------|
| Configuration ID | config_3_1 |
| Data Type        | INTEGER |
| Range | 0 to 1 |
| Default Value | 0 |


#### 4: Invert Switch

Switch paddle behaviour  


##### Overview 

To change the top of the transmitter to OFF and the bottom of the transmitter to ON, set parameter 4 to 1. To change back to original settings, set this parameter to the value of 0.  


| Property         | Value    |
|------------------|----------|
| Configuration ID | config_4_1 |
| Data Type        | INTEGER |
| Range | 0 to 1 |
| Default Value | 0 |


#### 5: Ignore Start Level Bit

Ignore Start Level When Receiving Dim Commands  


##### Overview 

The ZTM230 can send Dim commands to Z-Wave enabled dimmers. The Dim command has a start level embedded in it. A dimmer receiving this command will start dimming from that start level. However, the command can be sent so that the dimmer ignores the start level and instead start dimming from its current level. By default, the ZTM230 sends the command so that the dimmer will start dimming from its current dim level rather then the start level embedded in the command. To change this, simply set the configuration parameter above to 0

**Note that this only affects a level that is reported or possibly sent by the ZTM230 since the ZTM230 does not control a load.**


| Property         | Value    |
|------------------|----------|
| Configuration ID | config_5_1 |
| Data Type        | INTEGER |
| Range | 0 to 1 |
| Default Value | 1 |


#### 7: On/Off Command dim step

##### Overview 

Dim step (dim rate) parameter. It can be set to a value of 1 to 99. This value indicates how many levels the dimmer will change when the timer (discussed below) expires.


| Property         | Value    |
|------------------|----------|
| Configuration ID | config_7_1 |
| Data Type        | INTEGER |
| Range | 1 to 99 |
| Default Value | 3 |


#### 8: On/Off Command dim timer

Dim timer parameter  


##### Overview 

Dim timer parameter (how fast the dim rate) parameter. It can be set to a value of 1 to 255. This value indicates in 10 millisecond resolution, how often the dim level will change. For example, if you set this parameter to 1, then the dim level will change every 10mS. If you set it to 255, then the dim level will change every 2.55 seconds.  


| Property         | Value    |
|------------------|----------|
| Configuration ID | config_8_1 |
| Data Type        | INTEGER |

#### 13: Disable group 4 during dim command

Disable group 4 during dim command  


##### Overview 

Note that this only affects a level that is reported or possibly sent by the ZTM230 since the ZTM230 does not control a load.  
  
After the ZTM230 is commanded to stop dimming when it has been dimming because of the DIM START command, it will then command the Z-Wave devices that are in Group 4 to its new level. To prevent the ZTM230 from commanding the Z-Wave devices in Group 4 during this particular occurrence, set Parameter 13 to the value of 1.


| Property         | Value    |
