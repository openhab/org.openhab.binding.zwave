| 4: SENSOR BINARY | SENSOR\_BINARY\_REPORT\_V2 |


#### 1: Motion Sensitivity

8 = high; 255 = low  


##### Overview 

Adjust detection by choosing a value from 8 to 255, where 8 stands for high sensitivity level (detection of the smallest movement) and 255 stands for very low sensitivity level


| Property         | Value    |
|------------------|----------|
| Configuration ID | config_1_1 |
| Data Type        | INTEGER |
| Range | 8 to 255 |
| Default Value | 12 |


#### 2: Trigger ON Duration

delay after motion before turning OFF  


##### Overview 

Set the duration (in seconds) you want the associated device to stay ON for after being triggered by the sensor before it automatically turns OFF. Must be greater than value set in parameter 6.


| Property         | Value    |
|------------------|----------|
| Configuration ID | config_2_2 |
| Data Type        | INTEGER |
| Range | 5 to 600 |
| Default Value | 30 |


#### 3: Trigger Action

Brightness to turn on the associated device 1-99, 255=ON  


##### Overview 

You can choose if your Mini Sensor turns an associated device on or off when sending the BASIC SET command. Use value 0 to turn the associated device OFF and value 255 to turn it ON. Adjust brightness level for a Z-Wave dimmer (Multilevel switch) by putting in any value between 1 and 99. 


| Property         | Value    |
|------------------|----------|
| Configuration ID | config_3_1 |
| Data Type        | INTEGER |
| Range | 0 to 255 |
| Default Value | 255 |


#### 4: Motion Detection

255=Motion Detection Enabled


| Property         | Value    |
|------------------|----------|
| Configuration ID | config_4_1 |
| Data Type        | INTEGER |
| Range | 0 to 255 |
| Default Value | 255 |


#### 5: Light Trigger Level

Max Light level which enables motion trigger  


##### Overview 

Set your light sensor as a secondary trigger for associated devices. If light level in a room falls beyond the set point and motion is detected, the Mini Sensor will send BASIC\_SET command to associated devices to turn ON. The number entered as the value corresponds to the number of LUX. By default, if motion has been detected by your Mini Sensor, the associated device will turn ON if light level last reported by the sensor is under 100 LUX. 


| Property         | Value    |
|------------------|----------|
| Configuration ID | config_5_2 |
| Data Type        | INTEGER |
| Range | 0 to 1000 |
| Default Value | 100 |


#### 6: Motion Trigger Interval

Minimum time between motion triggers.  


##### Overview 

Adjust the time (in seconds) when motion is reported again after initial trigger. By default, with continued motion, the Mini Sensor will report motion again 8 seconds after it's last detection. The value set for this parameter can NOT be greater than value set in parameter 2. NOTE: Small interval will increase activity and decrease battery life.


| Property         | Value    |
|------------------|----------|
| Configuration ID | config_6_1 |
| Data Type        | INTEGER |
| Range | 1 to 8 |
| Default Value | 8 |


#### 7: Light Polling Interval

Interval between light level reporting  


##### Overview 

Decide how often (in seconds) you want the Mini Sensor to report light level to the controller and associated devices. By default, the Mini Sensor will report light level values every 3 minutes. The value set for this parameter can NOT be greater than the wake-up interval. NOTE: Small interval will increase activity and decrease battery life.


| Property         | Value    |
|------------------|----------|
| Configuration ID | config_7_2 |
| Data Type        | INTEGER |
| Range | 60 to 36000 |
| Default Value | 180 |


#### 8: Light Trigger

255=enable Light sensor  


##### Overview 

Use this parameter to enable and disable the light sensor as secondary trigger. If this feature is enabled, the Mini Sensor will activate associated devices based on motion AND light level set in parameter 5


| Property         | Value    |
|------------------|----------|
| Configuration ID | config_8_1 |
| Data Type        | INTEGER |
| Range | 0 to 255 |
| Default Value | 0 |


#### 9: Light Report

Light level change to be reported.  


##### Overview 

Choose light level (in LUX) change to be reported by the Mini Sensor to the controller. By default, the sensor will report any change of 100 LUX or more.


| Property         | Value    |
|------------------|----------|
| Configuration ID | config_9_1 |
| Data Type        | INTEGER |
| Range | 0 to 255 |
| Default Value | 255 |


#### 10: LED Notifications

0=disable, 1=enable  


##### Overview 

Use this parameter to turn LED notifications on or off for motion detection.


| Property         | Value    |
|------------------|----------|
| Configuration ID | config_10_1 |
| Data Type        | INTEGER |
| Range | 0 to 1 |
| Default Value | 1 |
