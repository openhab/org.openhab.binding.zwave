The 10795 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The 10795 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

The Monoprice Z-Wave Door/Window Sensor mounts to a door or window, detects when it is opened or closed, and sends a Z-Wave trigger signal to the smart home network. It also has a tamper-proof switch, which will trigger a notification when the sensor's cap is removed. These trigger signals can be used to activate various other devices and perform preprogrammed tasks. When the sensor is included into a secured Z-Wave network, all communications will be encrypted using AES encryption.

### Inclusion Information

  * Add the sensor to an existing Z-Wave network by first putting your main Z-Wave Interface Controller (ZIC) into "inclusion" mode.
  * Follow the instructions that came with your ZIC to pair the sensor with the controller.
  * Place the sensor within 1 meter of the ZIC, then press and hold the program switch for about 1 second.
  * The LED will stop flashing and will glow steadily when pairing is complete.

### Exclusion Information

  * To remove the sensor from an existing Z-Wave network, first put the ZIC into "exclusion" mode and follow its instructions for removing a device.
  * With the sensor within 1 meter of the ZIC, press and hold the program switch for about 1 second to exclude the sensor from the network.

### Wakeup Information

The 10795 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


Put the sensor into "awake" mode by removing the rear cover.Â  When in "awake" mode it can receive inclusion, exclusion, and association commands from the ZIC

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the 10795 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Sensor (Binary) | sensor_door | sensor_door | Door | Contact | 
| Sensor (Alarm) | alarm_entry | alarm_entry | Door | Switch | 
| Tamper Alarm | alarm_tamper | alarm_tamper |  | Switch | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | system.battery_level | Battery | Number |

### Sensor (Binary)
Indicates if the door/window is open or closed.

The ```sensor_door``` channel is of type ```sensor_door``` and supports the ```Contact``` item and is in the ```Door``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Contact``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OPEN | Open |
| CLOSED | Closed |

### Sensor (Alarm)
Indicates if the entry alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_entry``` channel is of type ```alarm_entry``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Door``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| ON | Open |
| OFF | Closed |

### Tamper Alarm
Indicates if the tamper alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_tamper``` channel is of type ```alarm_tamper``` and supports the ```Switch``` item. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.


## Device Configuration

The device has no configuration parameters defined.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The 10795 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Controller Updates


Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.
