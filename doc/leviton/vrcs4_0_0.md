The VRCS4 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

Vizia RF + 4-Button Remote Scene Controller, rated @ 120/240 VAC, 50/60HZ;  
The top four buttons provide ON/OFF switching of four scenes.  Each button can have up to 32 devices associated with it. The bottom button transmits DIM/BRIGHT commands to the most recently switched-ON scene.

### Inclusion Information

To access programming mode, press and hold the left side of buttons 1 and 3. Wait 5 seconds until the LEDs turn amber then release the buttons.  The LEDs will blink amber.

While holding your system controller close the the 4-Scene controller (approximately 1 foot) put your system comptroller into inclusion mode. When the 4-Scene controller is included in your system the LEDs will turn off. If the LEDs on the 4-Scene controller turn red while including, there has been a communications problem.

The instructions state that only one device may be included at a time and it seems that inclusion works best if the system controller is put in including mode after the device is in programming mode.

If the 4-Scene controller has been successfully included in the network and the user tries to include it again without first excluding it from the network, the controller will retain the first node ID it had received and ignore the second.

### Exclusion Information

To access programming mode, press and hold the left side of buttons 1 and 3. Wait 5 seconds until the LEDs turn amber then release the buttons.  The LEDs will blink amber.

While holding your system controller close the the 4-Scene controller (approximately 1 foot) put your system comptroller into exclusion mode. When the 4-Scene controller is excluded from your system the LEDs will turn off.

If the LEDs on the 4-Zone controller turn red while excluding, there has been a communications problem.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the VRCS4 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Scene Number | scene_number | scene_number |  | Number | 

### Scene Number
Triggers when a scene button is pressed.

The ```scene_number``` channel is of type ```scene_number``` and supports the ```Number``` item.



## Device Configuration

The device has no configuration parameters defined.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The VRCS4 supports 4 association groups.

### Group 1: Group 1
