Network Wide Inclusion to a Z-Wave Network

Enter Setup Mode

  1. Hold the top rocker for 7 seconds.
  2. The Status LED will turn AMBER, release and the Status LED will blink AMBER. 
  3. The device is now in setup mode
  4. Enter setup mode (see above)
  5.  Tap the top rocker 1 time. The Status LED will quickly ﬂash GREEN. The device is now ready to learn into the Z-Wave network.
  6. Use the Z-Wave controller to complete the device enrollment process (follow the Z-Wave controller instructions)

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZW15S supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Lifeline
A notification is sent to the nodes in this association group when a Lifeline event occurs

All nodes in the association group receive notification of status changes

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Binary Switch Set

Binart Switch Set
All nodes in the association group receive a command based on the ON/OFF button presses

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Basic Set

Basic Set
All notes in the association group receive a command based on the ON/OFF button presses
