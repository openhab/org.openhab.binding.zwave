Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 3 | Minimum Fan Speed | Controls the minimum fan speed. |
| 4 | Maximum Fan Speed | Controls the maximum fan speed |
| 5 | Preset Fan Speed Level | Controls the initial fan speed level when turned on |
| 6 | LED Level Indicator Timeout | Controls timeout for LED speed indicator, in seconds |
| 7 | Status LED Behavior | Controls behavior of the status LED |

### Parameter 3: Minimum Fan Speed

Controls the minimum fan speed.

Values in the range 0 to 99 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```10```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 4: Maximum Fan Speed

Controls the maximum fan speed

Values in the range 0 to 99 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```99```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_4_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 5: Preset Fan Speed Level

Controls the initial fan speed level when turned on
This setting controls the speed the fan is set to when it turns on. When '0', the fan will use the last known speed setting. Otherwise, 1-99 control the initial fan speed, with 99 being the fastest.
Values in the range 0 to 99 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_5_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 6: LED Level Indicator Timeout

Controls timeout for LED speed indicator, in seconds
0=Level indicator is always off. 255=Level indicator is always on. Anything in between is the number of seconds the level indicator LED will stay on for, after the fan speed has been adjusted.
Values in the range 0 to 255 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```3```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_6_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 7: Status LED Behavior

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZW4SF supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Lifeline


Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.
