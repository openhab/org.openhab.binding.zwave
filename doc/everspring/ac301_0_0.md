## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The AC301 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Notification Report

When the unit is powered up first time, the unit will send a Notification Report and Clock report to the node of Group 1.

When the battery level of the unit drops to an unacceptable level, the unit will emit Battery report to the nodes of Group 1.

When performing Factory Reset the unit will send Device Reset Locally Notification to the node of Group1.

The unit will send Sensor Multilevel Report to the node of Group 1 every two hours.

When changing mod of the unit, it will send Thermostat Mode Report to the node of Group 1.

When changing target value of temperature, the unit will send Thermostat Setpoint Report to the node of Group 1.

When changing the state of button lock, the unit will send Protection Report to the node of Group 1.

Association group 1 supports 1 node.
