The  AN180 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

The On/Off Mini Plug is a Z-Wave enabled device which is fully compatible with any Z-Wave enabled network. Z-WaveTM enabled devices displaying the Z-Wave logo can also be used with it regardless of the manufacturer, and ours can also be used in other manufacturer’s Z-Wave enabled networks. Inclusion of this unit on other manufacturer’s Wireless Controller menu allows remote operation of the unit and the connected load. The On/Off Mini Plug is designed to control the on/off status of appliances load in your house. At 220-240V voltage, this Plug can support up to 1500W resistive.

### Inclusion Information

#### Adding to Z-Wave Network

On the unit you can find a link key which is used to carry out the function of inclusion, exclusion, and reset. When power is applied for the first time, the LED will flash on and off alternately and repeatedly, implying that it has not been assigned a node ID and cannot work with other Z-Wave devices yet. This unit supports the Auto Inclusion function when power is applied and no node ID is stored in the memory.

#### Auto Inclusion

The module may automatically execute the function of inclusion when...

  1. The power is applied for the first time and no node ID has been stored in the module.
  2. The execution of reset is successful where the stored node ID is cleared.

**Note**: The duration for Auto Inclusion is about 4 minutes. Unlike the “inclusion” procedure shown in the table below, the execution of Auto Inclusion is automatic without the necessity of pressing the link key.

#### Inclusion

  1. Put the Z-Wave Controller into inclusion mode.
  2. Press the link key three times within 1.5 seconds to put the unit into inclusion mode.

#### No node ID

The Controller does not allocate a node ID to the unit. -> LED indication: 2-second on, 2-second off

#### Reset

(Use this procedure only in the event that the network primary controller is missing, or otherwise inoperable.)

  1. Press the link key three times within 1.5 seconds to put the unit into exclusion mode.
  2. Within 1 secondof step 1, press link key again and hold it until LED is off (about 5 seconds).
  3. Node ID is excluded.The device reverts to factory default state and will be in auto-inclusion mode for 4 minutes.

### Exclusion Information

  1. Put the Z-Wave Controller into exclusion mode.
  2. Press the link key three times within 1.5 seconds to put the unit into exclusion mode.

### General Usage Information

Under normal operation mode, press the on/off button on the unit to control the on/off status of the connected load. When power is on, the LED indicator will turn on for 5 seconds and then turn off (or slow flash if no node ID is stored). The unit can also be controlled by receiving command signals from the Z-Wave Controller.

The unit is able to remember the status of the relay when power is cut off (such as power black-out). When power is supplied again, the unit will resume the last status of the relay (on or off) automatically.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the  AN180 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |

The ```alarm_general``` channel is of type ```alarm_general``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Alarm``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |

### Alarm (power)
Indicates if a power alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_power``` channel is of type ```alarm_power``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |

## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 3 configuration parameters available in the  AN180.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Basic Set Command value | Defines value for Basic Set command |
| 2 | Delaying time Group 1 | The delaying time to report to Group 1 |
| 3 | Remember the last status | Remember the last status |
|  | Switch All Mode | Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands |

### Parameter 1: Basic Set Command value

Defines value for Basic Set command
Range: 0~99 , 255
The following option values may be configured, in addition to values in the range 0 to 99 -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 255 | On |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```255``` (On).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Delaying time Group 1

The delaying time to report to Group 1

Values in the range 3 to 25 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```3```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The  AN180 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Controller communicaion
Supports: Binary Switch Report, Notification Report, Device Reset Locally Notification

  * When the unit is powered for the first time, the unit will send a Notification Report to the node of Group 1. 
  * When setting the unit or changing the unit’s status, the unit will send a Binary Switch Report to the node of Group 1. 
  * Device Reset: When performing Reset the unit will send Device Reset Locally Notification to the node of Group1. 
  * The minimum interval time between two reports sent from this unit to the node of Group 1 is 3 seconds. Refer to Configuration parameter 2 for more information.

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: On/Off control

On/Off control
When the **button** on the unit or the wall switch is pressed, the unit will send a **Basic Set** command to the nodes of Group 2. When the unit is OFF, Basic Set Value = 0x00. When the unit is ON, Basic Set Value = 0xFF (255).

Association group 2 supports 4 nodes.
