# SM810 Door/Window Detector
This describes the Z-Wave device *SM810*, manufactured by *Everspring* with the thing type UID of ```everspring_sm810_00_000```.

The device is in the category of *Sensor*, defining Device used to measure something.

The SM810 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The SM810 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

The Door/Window Detector is a Z-Wave Plus enabled device and is fully compatible with any Z-Wave enabled network. The device can be set up in a Z-wave network to communicate directly with other end devices such as lighting controllers, or to report directly to a Z-wave controller (usually a gateway).

### Inclusion Information

Auto Inclusion -The power is applied for the first time and no node ID has been stored in the module, or after executing reset.

Manual Inclusion

  1. Put the Z-Wave Controller into inclusion mode.
  2. Press the tamper switch 3 times within 1.5 seconds to put the unit into inclusion mode.  

### Exclusion Information

  1. Put the Z - Wave Controller into exclusion mode.  
  2. Press the tamper switch 3 times within 1.5 Seconds to put the unit into exclusion mode.  

### Wakeup Information

The SM810 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


After it has been included into a Z-wave network, the detector will go to sleep but send a Wakeup Notifiication Command periodically at preset period to the controller. The detector will stay awake for 10 seconds at least and then go back to sleep to conserve battery life.

The time internal between Wakeup Notification Commands can be set in the Wakeup Command Class based on the range values below:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      Minimum Wake Up Interval
    </td>
    
    <td>
      <p>
        600s (10 minutes)
      </p>
    </td>
  </tr>

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the SM810 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Binary Sensor | sensor_binary | sensor_binary |  | Switch | 
| Door Sensor | sensor_door | sensor_door | Door | Contact | 
| Alarm (Low battery) | alarm_battery | alarm_battery | LowBattery | Switch | 
| Alarm (Burglar) | alarm_burglar | alarm_burglar | Door | Switch | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | system.battery_level | Battery | Number |

### Binary Sensor
Indicates if a sensor has triggered.

The ```sensor_binary``` channel is of type ```sensor_binary``` and supports the ```Switch``` item. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| ON | Triggered |
| OFF | Untriggered |

### Door Sensor
Indicates if the door/window is open or closed.

The ```sensor_door``` channel is of type ```sensor_door``` and supports the ```Contact``` item and is in the ```Door``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Contact``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OPEN | Open |
| CLOSED | Closed |

### Alarm (Low battery)
Indicates if the low battery alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_battery``` channel is of type ```alarm_battery``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```LowBattery``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |

### Alarm (Burglar)
Indicates if the burglar alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_burglar``` channel is of type ```alarm_burglar``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Door``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.


## Device Configuration

The device has no configuration parameters defined.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The SM810 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Notification Report, Device Reset Locally Notification
Group 1 commands:

  * When the unit is powered up and was already a part of a Z-Wave network, the unit will send a Notification Report to the node of Group 1.
  * When the tamper switch is released, the unit will send ALARM REPORT command to the nodes of Group 1.
  * Upon detector status being changed, the unit will check its battery status simultaneously. When the battery level of the unit drops to an unacceptable level, the unit will emit Battery report to the nodes of Group 1.
  * When performing Factory Reset the unit will send Device Reset Locally Notification to the node of Group 1.

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Basic Set

Basic Set
Group 2 Commands:

  * When the door/window is opened, the unit will send BASIC_SET command which contains a value to the nodes of Group 2.
  * When the door/window is closed, the BASIC_SET command will also be sent to the nodes of Group 2.

Association group 2 supports 4 nodes.
