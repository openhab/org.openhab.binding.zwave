The ST814 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The ST814 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

The Temperature/Humidity Detector is a Z-WaveTM enabled device which is fully compatible with any Z-WaveTM enabled network. Z-WaveTM enabled devices displaying the Z-WaveTM logo can also be used with it regardless of the manufacturer, and ours can also be used in other manufacturer’s Z-WaveTM enabled networks. Inclusion of this detector on other manufacturer’s Wireless Controller menu allows remote operation of connected modules when the detector is triggered.

The Temperature/Humidity Detector is designed to monitor the current temperature and humidity of ambient environment. The reading of temperature/humidity can be reported to you on a regular base at your disposal. If temperature/humidity reaches set points, the detector will send alerts to associated devices for further execution. Since sudden temperature/humidity change may cause health problems to people such as elderly or very young children, Temp./Humid. Detector provides you most up-to-date temperature and humidity reading for you to watch your family’s health. 

### Inclusion Information

One of function key (C/F/L) is used to carry out inclusion, exclusion, association and reset. When the detector is first powered up, the reading in RF mode is 00 which implies that it hasn’t been allocated a node ID and cannot work with Z-WaveTM enabled devices. The Temp./Humid. Detector will stay “awake” for 10 minutes when power is first applied to allow time for configuration.

  * Pressing key 3 times within 1.5 seconds will enter inclusion mode

### Exclusion Information

One of function key (C/F/L) is used to carry out inclusion, exclusion, association and reset. When the detector is first powered up, the reading in RF mode is 00 which implies that it hasn’t been allocated a node ID and cannot work with Z-WaveTM enabled devices. The Temp./Humid. Detector will stay “awake” for 10 minutes when power is first applied to allow time for configuration.

  * Pressing key 3 times within 1.5 seconds will enter exclusion mode

### Wakeup Information

The ST814 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


  * Pressing key 3 times within 1.5 seconds will wake the device

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ST814 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Reports


Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Control


Association group 2 supports 3 nodes.
