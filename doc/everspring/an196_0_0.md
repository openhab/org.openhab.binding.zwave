The AN196 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

The dual relay in-wall module contains two sets of relays and switches, with each set dedicated for controlling lighting or an appliance in your home.

The module is a Z-WaveTM enabled device which is fully compatible with any Z-WaveTM enabled network.

Each relay can be turned on/off individually using Z-waveTM commands or using the switches connected to the module. At 230V voltage, this module can support up to 2\*4.3A output, 2\*1000W resistive load.

This unit is to be installed and sealed inside an electrical switch box

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The AN196 supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
When the unit is powered up for first time, a Notification Report will be sent to the node of Group 1. When performing Factory Reset, a Device Reset Locally Notification will be sent to the node of Group 1. When relay is activated through the switch, the

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: On/Off Control	

When switch 1 is pressed, a BASIC SET command containing a value will be sent to the node of Group 2 (When relay is off, Basic Set Value=0x00, when relay is on, Basic Set Value=0xFF).

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: On/Off Control	

When switch 2 is pressed, a BASIC SET command containing a value will be sent to the node of Group 3 (When relay is off, Basic Set Value=0x00, when relay is on, Basic Set Value=0xFF).

Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.
