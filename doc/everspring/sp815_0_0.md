The SP815 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The SP815 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

The SP815 is a multifunction device with motion detector and temperature/humidity sensor. It uses Passive Infra-Red (PIR) technology to detect movement in a protected area by sensing the changes of thermal radiation caused by the moving body within or across the field of detection. Featuring dual PIR sensor designed with dual lens technology, this detector is immune to presence of pets in the home allowing your pet to move freely without causing false alarms.

This product is a Z-Wave Plus enabled device and is fully compatible with any Z-Wave enabled network. The device can be set up in a Z-Wave network to communicate directly with other end devices such as smartplugs, or to report directly to a Z-Wave controller (usually a gateway).

When the motion detector is triggered, an alarm signal will be emitted to the controller and the controller, after receiving the signal, will perform certain action according to its settings.

The product has a built in digital temperature sensor and humidity sensor to report environmental condition of the protected area to the controller.

This product supports the S2 security protocol that uses encrypted Z-Wave Plus messages to communicate to other security-enabled Z-Wave Plus products. A security-enabled Z-Wave Plus Controller must be used in order to fully utilize the security features of this product.

### Wakeup Information

The SP815 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


After it has been included into a Z-Wave network, the detector will go to sleep but will send a Wakeup Notification Command periodically at preset period to the controller. The Motion detector will stay awake for 10 seconds at least and then go back to sleep to conserve battery life.

The time interval between Wakeup Notification Commands can be set in the Wakeup Command Class based on the range values below: 

Minimum Wake Up Interval 600s (10 minutes)

Maximum Wake Up Interval 86400s (1 day)

Default Wake Up Interval 14400s (4 hours)

Wake Up Interval Step Seconds 600s (10 minutes)

For manual wake up press and hold tamper switch for 10 seconds.

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.


## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 3 configuration parameters available in the SP815.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Temperature & Humidity Auto Report period setting | Temperature and Humidity Auto Report period setting |
| 2 | Re-trigger Interval Setting (for PIR sensor only) | Re-trigger Interval Setting (for PIR sensor only) |
| 3 | Trigger Off Interval Setting | Trigger Off Interval Setting |
|  | Wakeup Interval | Sets the interval at which the device will accept commands from the controller |
|  | Wakeup Node | Sets the node ID of the device to receive the wakeup notifications |

### Parameter 1: Temperature & Humidity Auto Report period setting

Temperature and Humidity Auto Report period setting

Values in the range 1 to 1440 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```30```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Re-trigger Interval Setting (for PIR sensor only)

Re-trigger Interval Setting (for PIR sensor only)
The parameter adjusts the sleep period after the detector has been triggered. No response will be made during this interval if a movement is presented. Longer re-trigger interval will result in longer battery life.
Values in the range 10 to 3600 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```180```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: Trigger Off Interval Setting

Trigger Off Interval Setting
This controls how long the connected lighting will stay on after the motion is detected This is useful for Group 2 associations where the detector is connected directly to another device such as smartplugs.
Values in the range 10 to 3600 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```15```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The SP815 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Battery Report, Device Reset Locally Notification, Notification Report


Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: PIR Control

Basic Set

Association group 2 supports 4 nodes.
