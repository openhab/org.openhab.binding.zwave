The SP817 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The SP817 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

The detector can be used as a security device or home automation device. When the detector is cooperated with security appliances, the detector is acting as a security device by detecting changes in infra-red radiation levels.

If a person moves within or across the devices field of vision, a trigger radio signal will be transmitted to cause full alarm condition in order to frighten intruders away.

Alternatively, when the detector is worked with Z-Wave controller, the detector can be set to perform the role of home automation device by detecting both changes in infra-red radiation levels and percentage of lux levels. Once night falls, the percentage of ambient illumination is lower than preset value. If a person moves within or across the devices field of vision, a trigger radio signal will be transmitted so as to turn connected lightings for better illumination.

This product supports the S2 security protocol that uses encrypted Z-Wave Plus messages to communicate to other security-enabled Z-Wave Plus products. A security-enabled Z-Wave Plus Controller must be used in order to fully utilize the security features of this product.

### Inclusion Information

Auto Inclusion

Network

  * Do not position the detector facing a window or direct sunlight.
  * The detector supports Auto Inclusion feature where it will automatically enter Inclusion mode when first powered up after a factory reset.
  * Where possible, mount the detector so that the path of an intruder would cut across the fan pattern rather than directly towards the detector.

  1. Use a screwdriver to detach the rear cover.
  2. Put a Z-Wave Controller into inclusion mode.
  3. Insert  battery to the battery compartment with the correct polarity. The LED on the device should turns ON.. 
      1. The Inclusion process should be completed when the LED stops blinking.
      2. Do not refit the rear cover yet.
      3. Note: If Auto Inclusion fails, refer to the Troubleshooting section regarding Manual Inclusion.

Manual Inclusion

  1. Put the Z-Wave Controller into inclusion mode.
  2. Press the tamper switch 3 times within 1.5 seconds to put the unit into inclusion mode.

### Exclusion Information

Manual Exclusion

  1. Put the Z-Wave Controller into inclusion mode.
  2. Press the tamper switch 3 times within 1.5 seconds to put the unit into inclusion mode.

### Wakeup Information

The SP817 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


For waking up please triple click the tamper switch

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.


## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 5 configuration parameters available in the SP817.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Basic Set Level | Basic Set Level |
| 3 | Sensitivity Level | Sensitivity Level |
| 4 | Re-trigger Interval | Re-trigger interval |
| 5 | Lux Level | Lux Level |
| 6 | On-Off Duration | On-Off Duration |
|  | Wakeup Interval | Sets the interval at which the device will accept commands from the controller |
|  | Wakeup Node | Sets the node ID of the device to receive the wakeup notifications |

### Parameter 1: Basic Set Level

Basic Set Level
When Basic Set Command is sent where contains a value, the receiver will take it for consideration; for instance, if a lamp module is received the Basic Set command of which value is decisive as to how bright of dim level of lamp module shall be.

Example: 0: OFF  
1-99: ON (Binary Switch Device)  
Dim Level (Multilevel Switch Device)  
Function: Basic Set level
Values in the range 1 to 99 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```99```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: Sensitivity Level

Sensitivity Level
In order to provide best efficiency of the detector, it is recommended to test the detector with movements form the farthest end of the coverage area at first time of use. If movements cannot be detected correctly simply adjust the sensitivity level . This can be configured form 1 through 10. 1 is Lowest sensitivity and 10 is the highest.
Values in the range 1 to 10 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```6```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 4: Re-trigger Interval

Re-trigger interval
USed to adjust the interval of being re-triggered after the detector has been triggered. No response will nee made during this interval if further movement is detected. Can be set between 5 secs and 2600 secs.
Values in the range 5 to 3600 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```180```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_4_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 5: Lux Level

Lux Level
Sets minimum Lux Level of ambient illumination necessary for Motion Detector to trigger.

The user can set a detecting percentage of lux level which determines when the light sensor will be activated. If percentage of lux level of ambient illumination falls below this percentage, and a person moves across or within the protected area, the detector will emit Z-Wave ON Command (i.e. Basic Set Command (Value = Basic Set Level)) to controller and activate connected modules and lighting. Percentage can be set between 1% to 100%.
Values in the range 1 to 100 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```20```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_5_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 6: On-Off Duration

On-Off Duration
The function of on-off duration setting will be useful if the detector is connected with a module or lighting. The duration determines how long the module/lighting should stay ON. For instance, Lamp Module turns off 100 secs after it has been turned on. This parameter can be configured with the value of 5 through 3600, where 5 means 5 second delay and 3600 means 3600 seconds of delay
Values in the range 5 to 3600 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```15```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_6_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The SP817 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Devices

When the detector is triggered, the uni will send BASIC_SET command which contains a value to the nodes of Group 2.

Association group 2 supports 4 nodes.
