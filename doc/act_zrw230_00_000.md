# ZRW230 Wall Mounted 3-Way Switch

This describes the Z-Wave device *ZRW230*, manufactured by *ACT - Advanced Control Technologies* with the thing type UID of ```act_zrw230_00_000```. 

Wall Mounted 3-Way Switch  


## Overview 

**ZRW230 WALL MOUNTED SWITCH**

The ZRW230 Wall Mounted 3-Way Switch is a component of the HomePro lighting control system.

This Wall Mounted Switch is designed to work with other Z-Wave enabled devices. Z-Wave nodes of other types can be added to the system and will also act as repeaters if they support this function of repeating the signal received to other modules in the system. 

As part of a Z-Wave network, the ZRW230 will also act as a wireless repeater to insure that commands intended for another device in the network are received. This is useful when the device would otherwise be out of the radio range of the wireless controller.

There are no field repairable assemblies on this unit.. If service is needed, the unit must be returned where purchased.

### Exclusion Information 

**Excluding from the Network**

#### 1: Set Ignore Start Level Bit

Set Ignore Start Level Bit When Transmitting Dim Commands  


##### Overview 

The ZRW230 can send Dim commands to Z-Wave enabled dimmers. The Dim command has a start level embedded in it. A dimmer receiving this command will start dimming from that start level. However, the command also has a bit that indicates whether the dimmer should ignore the start level. If the bit is set to 1, the dimmer will ignore the start level and instead start dimming from its current level. If this bit is set to 0, the dimmer will not ignore the start level.


| Property         | Value    |
|------------------|----------|
| Configuration ID | config_1_1 |
| Data Type        | INTEGER || Default Value | 1 |
| Options | Dimmer will not ignore the start level (0) |
|  | Dimmer will ignore the start level (1) |


#### 2: Suspend Group 4

Stop transmitting to devices that are “associated” into Group 4  


##### Overview 

You may wish to disable transmitting commands to Z-Wave devices that are in Group 4 without “disassociating” those devices from the group. Setting parameter 2 to the value of 1 will stop the ZRW230 from transmitting to devices that are “associated” into Group 4.


| Property         | Value    |
|------------------|----------|
| Configuration ID | config_2_1 |
| Data Type        | INTEGER || Default Value | 0 |
| Options | Enable transmitting to devices “associated” into Group 4 (0) |
|  | Stop transmitting to devices “associated” into Group 4 (1) |


#### 3: Night Light

LED behaviour of the ZRW230 switch  


##### Overview 

The LED on the ZRW230 will by default, turn ON when the load attached is turned ON. To make the LED turn ON when the load attached is turned OFF instead, set parameter 3 to a value of 1.


| Property         | Value    |
|------------------|----------|
| Configuration ID | config_3_1 |
| Data Type        | INTEGER || Default Value | 0 |
| Options | Turn LED ON when the load is turned ON (0) |
|  | Turn LED ON when the load is turned OFF (1) |


#### 4: Invert Switch

Switch (paddle) behaviour.  


##### Overview 

To change the top of the switch to OFF and the bottom of the switch ON , set parameter 4 to 1.


| Property         | Value    |
|------------------|----------|
| Configuration ID | config_4_1 |
| Data Type        | INTEGER || Default Value | 0 |
| Options | Top of switch is ON, bottom is OFF (0) |
|  | Top of switch is OFF, bottom is ON (1) |


#### 14: Enable Shade Control Group 2

The ZRW230 can operate shade control devices via its group 2  


##### Overview 

The ZRW230 can operate shade control devices via its group 2 if this configuration parameter is set to 1.


| Property         | Value    |
|------------------|----------|
| Configuration ID | config_14_1 |
| Data Type        | INTEGER || Default Value | 0 |
| Options | Disable operation of shade control devices via group 2 (0) |
|  | Enable operation of shade control devices via group 2 (1) |


#### 15: Enable Shade Control Group 3

The ZRW230 can operate shade control devices via its group 3  


##### Overview

#### 19: LED Transmission Indication

LED Transmission Indication  


##### Overview 

The ZRW230 will flicker its LED when it is transmitting to any of its 4 groups. This flickering can be set to not flicker at all (set to 0), to flicker the entire time it is transmitting (set to 1), or to flicker for only 1 second when it begins transmitting (set to 2). By default, the ZRW230 is set to flicker for only 1 second.

|  | LED will flicker the entire time while transmitting (1) |
|  | LED will flicker 1 second when it begins transmitting (2) |


#### 1: Tapping paddle once

  


##### Overview 

Group 1 Control:

If you associate a Z-Wave device into Group 1, you can turn that device ON and OFF by tapping the top or bottom of the switch *once*. The load attached to the ZRW230 will also turn on or off.

Associating nodes into group 2 or 3 will cause a very slight delay before the command is transmitted to group 1 nodes.

You can brighten the controlled device by pushing and holding the top of the switch, dim by pushing and holding
