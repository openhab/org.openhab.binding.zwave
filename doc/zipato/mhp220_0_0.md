## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The MH-P220 supports 4 association groups.

### Group 1: Reports device’s dimming state

reports device’s dimming state. It supports only one Node ID. A controller / gateway SHOULD be associated to this AG.

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: S1 Basic Set Command

to control the associated devices synchonously. When S1’s state changes, it will send “Basic Set Command” to these devices.

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: S1 Multi-level Set Command

to control the associated devices synchronously. When S1’s state changes, it will send “Multi-level Set Command” to these devices.

Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 4: S2 Basic Set Command

to control the associated devices synchronously. When S2’s state changes, it will send “Basic Set Command” to these devices.

Association group 4 supports 5 nodes.
