The PAN04 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

This product can be operated in any Z-Wave network with other Z-Wave certified devices from other manufacturers. All non-battery operated nodes within the network will act as repeaters regardless of vendor to increase reliability of the network. Micro module Switch Double is a transceiver which is a Z-Wave Plus enabled device and is fully compatible with any Z-Wave enabled network. Mini size design allow the module to be easily hidden into the wall box which is good for the house decoration.

There are many kinds of application for using the module to switch AC power ON and OFF, one of which is the light control. The new smart relay calibration technology can reduce the inrush current caused by the load and let the module work perfectly with many kinds of light like incandescent, fluorescent and LED light.

This Micro module is able to detect Instant power wattage and overload wattage (current 7.5A) of connected light or appliances. When detecting overload state, the switch will be disabled and its ON/OFF button will be locked during which LED will flash repeatedly. Unplugging and reconnecting the Module will reset its overload condition to normal status.
