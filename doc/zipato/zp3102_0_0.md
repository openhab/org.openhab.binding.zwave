# ZP3102 Multi Sensor Dual: motion and temperature sensor
This describes the Z-Wave device *ZP3102*, manufactured by *Zipato* with the thing type UID of ```zipato_zp3102_00_000```.

# Overview

Presence detector and temperature meter in one device. Zipato Multisensor Duo offers elaborate security and ambient sensing options. The multifunctional nature of this product allows you to detect motion, and measure the room’s temperature. It can be used to automatically trigger other Z-Wave devices when activated.

## Inclusion Information

Put your Z-Wave Controller into “inclusion” mode, and follow the instructions to add Multisensor Duo to your controller. To get in the “inclusion” mode, the distance between sensor and controller should be up to 1 meter. Press the program switch of Multisensor Duo once. The LED on the sensor should stop flashing, if not, please try again.

## Exclusion Information

Put your Z-Wave Controller into “exclusion” mode, and follow the instructions to remove the Multisensor Duo from you controller network. Press the program switch of Multisensor Duo once to be excluded. The LED on the Multisensor Duo should start to flash.

## Wakeup Information

Remove the rear cover to wake up the device, or set the wake up interval time from 10 minutes to 1 week. The battery will be drained quickly if you fail to replace the cover after using that method to wake up the device.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the ZP3102

| Channel | Channel Id | Category | Item Type |
|---------|------------|----------|-----------|
| Binary Sensor | sensor_binary | Door | Switch | 
| Sensor (temperature) | sensor_temperature | Temperature | Number | 
| Alarm (burglar) | alarm_burglar | Door | Switch | 

### Binary Sensor

The ```sensor_binary``` channel supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Door``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| ON | Triggered |
| OFF | Untriggered |

### Sensor (temperature)

The ```sensor_temperature``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Temperature``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Alarm (burglar)

The ```alarm_burglar``` channel supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Door``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | Ok |
| ON | Alarm |



## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 3 configuration parameters available in the ZP3102.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | On time in minutes | Delay before sending OFF |
| 2 | 	Celsius / Fahrenheit | 0 = Celsius, 1 = Fahrenheit |
| 3 | Infrared sensor sensitivity adjustment | 1 is most sensitive, 7 is least |

### Parameter 1: On time in minutes

Delay before sending OFF

Values in the range 1 to 255 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is 3.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: 	Celsius / Fahrenheit

0 = Celsius, 1 = Fahrenheit

The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Celsius |
| 1 | Fahrenheit |

The manufacturer defined default value is 0 (Celsius).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: Infrared sensor sensitivity adjustment

1 is most sensitive, 7 is least
(Parameter 3) Infrared sensor sensitivity adjustment, 7 levels sensitivity, 1 = most sensitive, 7 = most insensitive, default value= 4
Values in the range 1 to 7 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is 4.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZP3102 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Control Command


This group supports 5 nodes.
