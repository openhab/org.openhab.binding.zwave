The HM-HS1CG-Z supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

This Smart Combustible Gas Sensor adopts super low power consumption Z-Wave Wireless module. Used for detecting combusting gas leakage and preventing danger caused by gas leakage it also can be used as Z-Wave repealer to extend wireless transmission distance. It adopts high stability semi-conductor gas sensor. Sensor alarms if gas density in air exceeds set alarm level. It is applicable for kitchen or possible gas leakage in in-door area.

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |



## Device Configuration

The device has no configuration parameters defined.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The HM-HS1CG-Z supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
  * Lifeline between controller and the device.
  * Supported command classes: Notification report, and Device Reset Locally notification.
  * Association Group description: Association group 1: Lifeline association group
  * Maximum supported node is 1.

Include command classes: Notification Report and Device Reset Locally notification.

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Root Device group(Notification)

Maximum supported nodes are 5.  
  
1-Notification reports status of gas detected or no gas  
  
    Association group 1: Lifeline association group  
  
2-When the sensor detects status change of gas detected and no gas detected, the device will be triggered.

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.
