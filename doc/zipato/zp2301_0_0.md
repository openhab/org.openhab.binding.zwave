The ZP2301 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The ZP2301 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

This sensor is a Z-Wave enabled device (interoperable, two-way RF mesh networking technology) and is fully compatible with any Z-Wave enabled network and its security framework. Every main powered Z-Wave enabled device acts as a signal repeater and multiple devices result in more possible transmission routes which helps eliminate “RF dead-spots”. Z-Wave enabled devices displaying the Z-Wave logo can also be used with it regardless of the manufacturer, and this device can also be used in other manufacturer’s Z-Wave enabled networks. Zipato Multisensor 4 in 1 sends Z-Wave signal when door or window is opened or closed or there is a humidity, temperature, luminance change.  
  


Door/Window, humidity, temperature and illuminance sensor

Primarily used as dry contact Door/Window sensor, it consists of two parts, magnet and a sensor

New Z-Wave 500 series chip supports multichannel operation and higher data rates (9.6/40/100kbps)

Can be used with various Z-Wave networks/controllers, regardless of the manufacturers

Easy installation  
  


1 | Push release button to open the rear cover.

2 | Using adhesive tape to affix the rear cover on the frame along the opening edge of door / window.

3 | Insert CR14250 into the battery compartment, if user presses the program switch, Multisensor 4 in 1 will send the Node Information Frame (NIF). Multisensor 4 in 1 will go to sleep if user didn\`t press the program switch within 20 seconds.   
  
LED Status for Z-Wave Network:

If user presses the program switch, the red LED will flash 5 times if the Multisensor 4 in 1 has not been included yet.

If user presses the program switch, the red LED will flash 1 times if the Multisensor 4 in 1 has been included.

### Inclusion Information

“Inclusion” (adding) to the Z-Wave network: Put the Z-Wave Controller into “inclusion” mode, and follow its instruction to add the Multisensor 4 in 1 to your controller. To get in the “inclusion” mode, the distance between sensor and controller is suggested to be within one meter. Press the program switch once on Multisensor 4 in 1 for sending the NIF. After sending NIF, Z-Wave will send the auto inclusion; otherwise, Multisensor 4 in 1 will go to sleep after 20 seconds.

### Exclusion Information

“Exclusion” (removing) from the Z-Wave network: Put the Z-Wave Controller into “exclusion” mode, and follow its instruction to delete the Multisensor 4 in 1 from your controller. Press the program switch of Multisensor 4 in 1 for 1 second at least to be excluded. Note: All user and network settings will be cleared and the device reset to factory defaults when the device is excluded.

### Wakeup Information

The ZP2301 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


Awake Mode: Press the Program SW, the LED will flash one time and Multisensor 4 in 1 will send “Wake Up Notification” after 5 seconds. If Multisensor 4 in 1 received “Wake Up No More Information” command then the Multisensor 4 in 1 will go to sleepor it will wait 10 seconds then go to sleep. It will precede all the commands after sending the “Wake Up Notification”.

Auto Wake Up: Use “Wake Up” command to set up the awaking time and send the wake up notification to controller. User can use command to change the auto wake up from 10 minutes to 1 week, Interval increment is 3 minutes.

## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 4 configuration parameters available in the ZP2301.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Temp_units | Temperature units |
| 2 | Temp_step | Temperature step |
| 4 | Humid_config | Humidity configuration |
| 4 | Light_config | Light sensor configuration |
|  | Wakeup Interval | Sets the interval at which the device will accept commands from the controller |
|  | Wakeup Node | Sets the node ID of the device to receive the wakeup notifications |

### Parameter 1: Temp_units

Temperature units
Temperature units. Celsius is default (0x00)
Values in the range 0 to 0 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Temp_step

Temperature step
Temperature step. Ranges from 0.1 to 5°C. One increment is 1/10th of °C
Values in the range 1 to 50 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 4: Humid_config

Humidity configuration
Setup from 0 or Off or 5%~50%. Preset is 10%
Values in the range 1 to 50 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```10```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_4_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 4: Light_config

Light sensor configuration
Setup from 0 or Off or 5%~50%. Preset is 10%
Values in the range 1 to 50 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```10```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_4_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZP2301 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: asso1

Support grouping identifier = 1, one group with 5 nodes.

Association is used for other capacity automatically.

All triggering reports & low voltage report will be sent to the associated nodes.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.
