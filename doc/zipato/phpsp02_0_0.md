# PSP02 Door/temp/illumination/motion sensor
This describes the Z-Wave device *PSP02*, manufactured by *[Zipato](http://www.zipato.com/)* with the thing type UID of ```zipato_phpsp02_00_000```.

The device is in the category of *Door*, defining Door sensors.

The PSP02 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The PSP02 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

Door/Window, motion, temperature and illumination sensor in one device.

Primarily used as Door/Window sensor, it consists of two parts: magnet and a sensor.

  * Very low power consumption.
  * Low battery battery indication.
  * Door/Window status and battery status auto-report.
  * LED indicator.
  * Over-the-air firmware update.
  * Tamper proof protection.

### Inclusion Information

Put the Z-Wave Controller in inclusion mode.

Pressing tamper key three times within 1.5 seconds will enter inclusion mode.

After successful inclusion, the device will wake to receive the setting command from the Z-Wave Controller in about 20 seconds.

### Exclusion Information

Put the Z-Wave Controller in exclusion mode.

Pressing tamper key three times within 1.5 seconds will enter exclusion mode. Node ID has been excluded.

### Wakeup Information

The PSP02 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


Any action.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The PSP02 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Reports target.

group to send reports to

Association group 1 supports 8 nodes.

### Group 2: Basic Set target

group to send Basic Set light commands to

Association group 2 supports 8 nodes.
