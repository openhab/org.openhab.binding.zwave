Indoor Dimmer Plug  


## Overview 

This plug-in Lamp Module is a transceiver which is a Z-Wave enabled device and is fully compatible with any Z-Wave enabled network. Z-Wave enabled devices displaying the Z-Wave logo can also be used with it regardless of the manufacturer, and ours can also be used in other manufacturer’s Z-Wave enabled networks.  Inclusion of the Lamp module on other manufacturer’s Wireless Controller menu allows remote On/Off control and dimming of lamps connected.  Each module is designed to act as a repeater.  Repeaters will re-transmit the RF signal to ensure that the signal is received by its intended destination by routing the signal around obstacles and radio dead spots.
