## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 4 configuration parameters available in the PAN08.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Watt meter report interval (5s) | Interval (x5 seconds) to send out watt meter report |
| 2 | KWH Meter Report Interval (10min) | Interval (x10 minutes) to send out KWH Meter Report |
| 3 | Threshold for Load Caution (10mA) | Threshold (x0.01A) of current for Load Caution |
| 4 | Threshold of KWh for Load Caution |  |

### Parameter 1: Watt meter report interval (5s)

Interval (x5 seconds) to send out watt meter report

Values in the range 1 to 32767 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```720```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: KWH Meter Report Interval (10min)

Interval (x10 minutes) to send out KWH Meter Report

Values in the range 1 to 32767 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```6```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: Threshold for Load Caution (10mA)

Threshold (x0.01A) of current for Load Caution

Values in the range 1 to 1100 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1100```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 4: Threshold of KWh for Load Caution

The manufacturer defined default value is ```10000```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_4_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The PAN08 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Blind Control


Association group 1 supports 1 node.
