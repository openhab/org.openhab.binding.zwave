The PST02A supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The PST02A does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

<p&gtThe slim multisensor PST02 has PIR, door/window, temperature and illumination, 4 sensors function in one, based on Z-WaveTM technology.</p&gt <p&gtIt is the Z-WaveTM plus product, it support the security, OTA... Those newest features of the Z-WaveTM technology. Z-WaveTM is a wireless communication protocol designed for home automation, specifically to remotely control applications in residential and light commercial environments. The technology uses a low-power RF radio embedded or retrofitted into home electronics devices and systems, such as lighting, home access control, entertainment systems and household appliances.</p&gt <p&gtThis product can be included and operated in any Z-WaveTM network with other Z-WaveTM certified devices from other manufacturers and/or other applications. All non-battery operated nodes within the network will act as repeaters regardless of vendor to increase reliability of the network.</p&gt <p&gtThe device adopt the Z-WaveTM 500 series chip, when your Z-WaveTM network system is all made by Z-WaveTM 500 series devices. The network system will have the advantages as below.</p&gt <ul&gt<li&gtConcurrent multi-channel support reduces external interference.</li&gt <li&gtBetter RF range, improve about 10 meters in indoor.</li&gt <li&gtSupport 100 Kbps transmit speed, speed up communication.</li&gt </ul&gt

### Inclusion Information

<ol&gt<li&gtHave Z-Wawe Controller entered I<strong&gtnclusion</strong&gt mode.</li&gt <li&gtPress <strong&gtTamper</strong&gt key <strong&gt3</strong&gt times in 1.5 seconds to enter the inclusion mode.</li&gt <li&gtAfter add success, the device will wake ti receive the setting command from Z-Wawe controller about 20 seconds</li&gt </ol&gt

### Exclusion Information

<ol&gt<li&gtHave Z-Wawe Controller entered <strong&gtExclusion</strong&gt mode.</li&gt <li&gtPress <strong&gtTamper</strong&gt key <strong&gt3</strong&gt times in 1.5 seconds to enter the exclusion mode.</li&gt <li&gtNode ID has been excluded</li&gt </ol&gt

### Wakeup Information

The PST02A does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


<p&gtAfter the device adding to the network, it will wake-up once per day in default. When it wake-up it will broadcast the “Wake Up Notification” message to the network, and wake-up 10 seconds for receive the setting commands.</p&gt <p&gtThe wake-up interval minimum setting is 30 minutes, and maximum setting is 120 hours. And the interval step is 30 minutes. If the user want to wake-up the device immediately, please remove the front cover, and press the tamper key once. The device will wake-up 10 seconds.</p&gt

### General Usage Information

<p&gt<b&gtRESET:</b&gt</p&gt <p&gtNotice: Use this procedure only in the event that the primary controller is lost or otherwise inoperable.</p&gt <ol&gt<li&gtPressing tamper key four times within 1.5 seconds and do not release the tamper key in the 4th pressed, and the LED will light ON.</li&gt <li&gtAfter 3 seconds the LED will turn OFF, after that within 2 seconds, release the tamper key. If successful, the LED will light ON one second. Otherwise, the LED will flash once.</li&gt <li&gtIDs are excluded and all settings will reset to factory default.</li&gt </ol&gt<p&gt<strong&gtASSOCIATION:</strong&gt</p&gt <ol&gt<li&gtHave Z-WaveTM Controller entered association mode.</li&gt <li&gtPressing tamper key three times within 1.5 seconds to enter the association mode.</li&gt </ol&gt<p&gtNote: The device support 2 groups. The group 1 is for receiving the report message, like triggered event, temperature, illumination etc. The group 2 is for light control, the device will send the “Basic Set” command to this group. And each group support 8 nodes maximum.</p&gt

Values in the range 0 to 99 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_22_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The PST02A supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Reports


Association group 1 supports 8 nodes.

### Group 2: Light Control


Association group 2 supports 8 nodes.
