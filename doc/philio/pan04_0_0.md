The PAN04 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

This in-wall dual relay switch module is a transceiver which is a Z-Wave<sup>TM</sup> enabled device and is fully compatible with any Z-Wave<sup>TM</sup> enabled network. Mini size design let the module can easily hide itself into the wall box and that will be good for the house decoration.

There are many kind of application by using the module to switch AC power On and Off, one main application is the light control. The new smart relay calibration technology can reduce the inrush current caused by the load and let the module work perfectly with many kind of light like incandescent, fluorescent and LED light. 

This in-wall switch module is able to detect Instant power wattage (5~1500W) and overload wattage (1600~1700W) of connected light or appliances. When detecting overload state, the Module will be disabled and its On/Off button will be lockout of which LED will flash quickly. However, disconnect and re-connect the Module will reset its overload condition to normal status.

### Inclusion Information

**Adding to Z-Wave<sup>TM</sup> Network**

In the front casing, there is an on/off button with LED indicator below which is used to toggle switch on and off or carry out inclusion, exclusion, reset or association. When first power is applied, its LED flashes on and off alternately and repeatedly at 2-second intervals. It implies that it has not been assigned a node ID and cannot work with Z-Wave enabled devices.

**Auto Inclusion**

The function of auto inclusion will be executed as long as the in wall switch does not have Node ID and just connect the switch to main power.

**Note:** Auto inclusion timeout is 4 minute during which the node information of explorer frame will be emitted once every 5 seconds. Unlike "inclusion" function as shown in the table below, the execution of auto inclusion is free from pressing the On/Off button on the Switch.

The table below lists an operation summary of basic Z-Wave functions. Please refer to the instructions for your Z-Wave<sup>TM</sup> Certificated Primary Controller to access the Setup function, and to include/exclude/associate devices.

  * No node ID 
      * The Z-Wave Controller does not allocate a node ID to the Switch
      * LED Indication: 2-second on, 2-second off
