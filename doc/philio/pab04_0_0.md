The PAB04 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

This valves controller PAB04 is a security enabled wireless switch, based on Z-Wave Plus technology.Â   


Connect PAB04 with an external water meter which can output pulse signals. PAB04 is able to detect instance water flow and the accumulated water.

### Inclusion Information

Pressing On/Off button three times within 2 seconds will enter inclusion mode.

### Exclusion Information

Pressing On/Off button three times within 2 seconds will enter exclusion mode.

### General Usage Information



## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the PAB04 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Switch | switch_binary | switch_binary | Switch | Switch | 
| Sensor (WATER_FLOW) | water_flow | water_flow |  |  | 
| Water meter (gal) | meter_water_gallons | meter_water_gallons | Water | Number | 
| Water meter (m3) | meter_water_cubic_meters | meter_water_cubic_meters | Water | Number | 

### Switch
Switch the power on and off.

The ```switch_binary``` channel is of type ```switch_binary``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Switch``` category.

|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Disable Report |
| 1 | Enable Report |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (Enable Report).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: Instant Water Flow Percent Reported

Instant Water Flow Percent Reported

The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|

|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Disabled |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```60```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_6_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The PAB04 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 1 node.
