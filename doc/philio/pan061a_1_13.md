## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The PAN06 supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Relay 1 + 2


Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Relay 1


Association group 2 supports 1 node.

### Group 3: Relay 2


Association group 3 supports 1 node.
