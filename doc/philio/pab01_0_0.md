## Device Configuration
The following table provides a summary of the 3 configuration parameters available in the ZIP-PAB01.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Power meter report period | Power meter report period, in 5 seconds unit. 720 -> 1 hour |
| 2 | Energy meter report period | The accumulated power consumption report period |
| 3 | Selected default endpoint | 1 => CT1 and CT2, 2 => CT1, 3 => CT2 |

### Parameter 1: Power meter report period
Power meter report period, in 5 seconds unit. 720 -> 1 hour
If the setting is configured for 1 hour (set value 720), the module will report its instant power consumption every 1 hour to the node of the corresponding group. The maximum interval to report its instant power consumption is 45h (5s \* 32767 / 3600 = 45h)
Values in the range 1 to 32767 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is 720.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Energy meter report period
The accumulated power consumption report period
If the setting is configured for 1 hour (set value 720), the module will report its accumulated power consumption every 1 hour to the node of the corresponding group. The maximum interval to report its accumulated power consumption is 45h (5s \* 32767 / 3600 = 45h)
Values in the range 1 to 32767 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is 720.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: Selected default endpoint
1 => CT1 and CT2, 2 => CT1, 3 => CT2
If Controller does not use Multi Channel command class to access the endpoint of the module, you may configure the endpoint that will react to the Basic Command Class, Binary Switch command class or Meter command class V3.
Values in the range 1 to 3 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is 1.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups
Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZIP-PAB01 supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: CT1 and CT2
Sum of CT1 and CT2
This group supports 1 nodes.

### Group 2: CT1
Data from CT1
This group supports 1 nodes.

### Group 3: CT2
Data from CT2
This group supports 1 nodes.
