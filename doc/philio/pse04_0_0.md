The PSE04 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

## Overview

The PSE04 is outdoor wireless siren with multiple sound capabilities.

### Inclusion Information

Put controller into inclusion mode. Press tamper key three times within 1.5 seconds. After device was added successfully, the LED will turn on for 1 second.

### Exclusion Information

Put controller into exclusion mode. Press tamper key three times within 1.5 seconds. 

### General Usage Information



## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the PSE04 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Sound | basic_number | basic_number |  | Number | 
| Sensor (temperature) | sensor_temperature | sensor_temperature | Temperature | Number:Temperature | 
| Tamper Notification | alarm_burglar | alarm_burglar | Door | Switch | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | system.battery_level | Battery | Number |

### Sound


The ```basic_number``` channel is of type ```basic_number``` and supports the ```Number``` item. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Sensor (temperature)
Indicates the current temperature.

The ```sensor_temperature``` channel is of type ```sensor_temperature``` and supports the ```Number:Temperature``` item and is in the ```Temperature``` category.

### Tamper Notification
Indicates if the burglar alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_burglar``` channel is of type ```alarm_burglar``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Door``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.


## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 7 configuration parameters available in the PSE04.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|

### Parameter 3: Customer Function 

Customer function switch, using bit control.
Bit0: Disable Trigger Alarm. 0:Enable , 1:Disable.

Bit1: Disable Sound. Only using optical alarm. 0:Enable ,1:Disable.

Bit2: Temperature Unit. 0:Fahrenheit , 1:Celsius.
Values in the range 0 to 7 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 4: Auto Report Temperature Time

The interval time for auto report the temperature.

Values in the range 0 to 255 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```12```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_4_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 5: Temperature Differential Report

The temperature differential to report.

Values in the range 0 to 255 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_5_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 6: Auto Report Battery Time

The interval time for auto report the battery level.

Values in the range 0 to 255 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```12```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_6_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 7: Play Sound Control

Control play sound's level and which sound.
Bit0~1: Play sound's level. Level 1~3, 0: Level 3.

Bit4~7: Which sound id will play, when control form controller. Sound ID 1~6, 0: Disable.
Values in the range 0 to 243 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```67```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_7_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The PSE04 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.
