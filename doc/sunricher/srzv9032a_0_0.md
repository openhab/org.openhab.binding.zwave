The SR-ZV9032A supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The SR-ZV9032A does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

The Z-Wave MultiSensor is a wireless, battery powered Z-Wave multi-sensor,

compatible with the Z-Wave Plus standard. The sensor combines 4 different sensors in one device: motion sensor, daylight sensor, temperature sensor and humidity sensor. It is developed to detect ambient values and movement and to transmit them with Z-Wave Plus.

The MultiSensor is designed to be installed quickly and easily on any surface with 3M tape or screws. The LED indicator signals motion, operating mode and can be used to see if device is within the Z-Wave network. The MultiSensor can be used for lighting scenes and presence monitoring systems. This device can be easily integrated into existing standard 55mm frames and installed on the wall with the bracket, or you can put it on the desk as a portable sensor.

The encryption modes that the sensor supports are S0, S2 Unauthenticated. When the motion sensor is being included into a Z-Wave network, you can use your primary controller/gateway to enable one encryption mode or disable encryption. (The primary controller/gateway shall support encryption mode configuration).

### Inclusion Information

Set primary controller/gateway into inclusion mode (Please refer to your primary controllers manual on how to turn your controller into inclusion).

Make sure the sensor does not belong to any Z-Wave network. If the sensor has already been included into a network, it shall be removed from the network first. There

are two methods to set the sensor into inclusion mode:

Triple press the action button on the sensor, it will set the sensor into inclusion mode.

Make sure that the sensor does not belong to any Z-Wave network, remove battery of the sensor and re-install again to reset power of the sensor, it will be set into inclusion mode automatically, and waiting to be included.

The LED indicator will flash fast to indicate successful inclusion.

Note: During inclusion process, triple press the action button 3 times again will enable the sensor to exit inclusion mode

### Exclusion Information

There are two exclusion methods:

Method 1: Exclusion from the primary controller/gateway as follows:

Set the primary controller/gateway into exclusion mode (Please refer to your primarycontrollers manual on how to set your controller into exclusion).

Triple press the action button, the sensor will be set to exclusion mode, the LEDindicator will flash fast and then the sensor will be removed from the network and reset to factory defaults.

Note: During exclusion process, triple press the action button 3 times again will enable the sensor to exit exclusion mode.

Method 2: Factory reset the sensor will force it to be excluded from a network. (please refer to the part “Factory Reset” of this manual)

### Wakeup Information

The SR-ZV9032A does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


Press and hold action button for 1 second to send Wakeup Notification CC to lifeline. 

### General Usage Information



## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the SR-ZV9032A -:

The ```sensor_temperature``` channel is of type ```sensor_temperature``` and supports the ```Number:Temperature``` item and is in the ```Temperature``` category.

### Sensor (luminance)
Indicates the current light reading.

The ```sensor_luminance``` channel is of type ```sensor_luminance``` and supports the ```Number``` item. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Sensor (relative humidity)
Indicates the current relative humidity.

The ```sensor_relhumidity``` channel is of type ```sensor_relhumidity``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Humidity``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Alarm (burglar)
Indicates if a motion alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_motion``` channel is of type ```alarm_motion``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Motion``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The SR-ZV9032A supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Lifeline
1. When factory reset the sensor, send "Device Reset Locally

Notification CC" to associated devices of this group to report

factory reset information.

2. When motion detected, send "Notification Report" to

associated devices of this group.

3. Send " Sensor Multilevel Report" to associated devices of

this group.

4. Send " Battery Report" to associated devices of this group.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Motion

MotionDetect
When motion detected, send “Basic Set 0xFF/0x00” to associated

devices of this group. 

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.
