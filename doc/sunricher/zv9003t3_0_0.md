The ZV9003T3-RGBW supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

The Wall controller is a Security Enabled Z-Wave Plus device that can both control other Z-Wave devices and activate scenes in Gateways. The wall controller can be included and operated in any Z-Wave network with other Z-Wave certified devices from other manufacturers and/or other applications. All non-battery operated nodes within the network will act as repeaters regardless of vendor to increase reliability of the network.

Although it is controlling other devices, the device cannot act as Z-Wave network controller (primary or secondary), so a security enabled controller is needed for take full advantage of all functionally for the device. It also supports the Over The Air (OTA) feature for the product’s firmware upgrade.

The wall controller has following functions:

  1. Control of groups of other Z-Wave devices using 'ON', 'OFF', Dim and Color Control commands.
  2. Activation of scenes in Gateways.

The encryption modes that the wall controller supports are S0, S2 Unauthenticated. When the wall controller is being included into a Z-Wave network, you can use your primary controller/gateway to enable one encryption mode or disable encryption. (The primary controller/gateway shall support encryption mode configuration).

### Inclusion Information

  1. Set primary controller/gateway into inclusion mode (Please refer to your primary controllers manual on how to turn your controller into inclusion).
  2. Make sure the wall controller does not belong to any Z-Wave network (please refer to the part “How to check whether the wall controller included to a network” of the manual).
  3. Short press the “inclusion/exclusion” button, or press and hold down “ALL ON/OFF” button for over 3 seconds, the wall controller will be set to inclusion mode, and waiting to be included, then LED indicator turns on and blinks 6 times quickly to indicate successful inclusion.

Once the wall controller quits “inclusion mode”, the LED indicator will turns off. There are 3 methods for the wall controller to quit “inclusion mode”:

  1. Automatically quits after successful inclusion.
  2. Quits after 25 seconds timeout.
  3. Press and hold down “ALL ON/OFF” button for over 3 seconds, or short press the “inclusion/exclusion” button to quit.

### Exclusion Information

There are two exclusion methods:

Method 1: Exclusion from the primary controller/gateway as follows:

  1. Set the primary controller/gateway into exclusion mode (Please refer to your primary controllers manual on how to set your controller into exclusion).
  2. Short press the “inclusion/exclusion” button, or press and hold down “ALL ON/OFF” button for over 3 seconds, the wall controller will be set to exclusion mode, and waiting to be excluded, then LED indicator turns on and shows 3 short blinks and 1 long blink to indicate successful exclusion.

Once the wall controller quits “exclusion mode”, the LED indicator will turns off. There are 3 methods for the wall controller to quit “exclusion mode”:

  1. Automatically quits after successful exclusion.
  2. Quits after 25 seconds timeout.
  3. Press and hold down “ALL ON/OFF” button for over 3 seconds, or short press the “inclusion/exclusion” button to quit.

Method 2: Factory reset the wall controller will force the wall controller to be excluded from a network. (please refer to the part “Factory Reset” of the manual)

Note: Factory reset is not recommended for exclusion, please use this procedure only if the primary controller/gateway is missing or otherwise inoperable.

### General Usage Information

**How to check whether the wall controller already included to a network**

  * Operate any button to check if there is indication from the LED indicator, and no LED indication means the wall controller does not belong to any network.
  * If the wall controller already belongs to a network, follow the exclusion process before including it in your network. Otherwise inclusion of this device will fail.

**Factory Reset**

  * Press and hold down “inclusion/exclusion” button for over 8 seconds, LED indicator blinks slowly to indicate successful factory reset, release “inclusion/exclusion” button, the wall controller will restart automatically.

**Association**

  * Z-Wave devices control other Z-Wave devices. The relationship between one device controlling another device is called association. In order to control a different device, the controlling device needs to maintain a list of devices that will receive controlling commands. These lists are called association groups and they are always related to certain events (e.g. button pressed). In case the event happens all devices stored in the respective association group will receive a common wireless command.

**Set and unset associations:**

(Note: All association information will be cleared automatically once the wall controller is excluded from a network.)

Associations can be assigned and remove either via Z-Wave commands or using the device itself.

  * Set association by operating primary controller/gateway to send packets to the wall controller: 
      * The primary controller/gateway sends packets to the wall controller using “Command Class ASSOCIATION” or “Command Class Multi Channel Association”
  * Set association by operating the wall controller and devices to be controlled: 
      * To control a Z-Wave device from the Wall Controller the node ID of this device needs to be assigned to one of the four association groups. This is a three-step process:
      * Press and hold down “ALL ON/OFF” button on the wall controller for over 3 seconds, LED indicator turns on.
      * Click any Group number button on the wall controller within 25 seconds to add the device to be controlled to the association group, double click any Group number button on the wall controller within 25 seconds to remove the device to be controlled to the association group.
      * Operate the device to be controlled to send Node Information Frame (please refer to the device manual) within 15 seconds, or set the device to exclusion mode within 15 seconds, since it will send Node Information Frame in exclusion mode, LED indications are as follows:
  * LED blinks 5 times to indicate that the wall controller failed to add the associated device (the association group has already added maximum quantity associated devices that it supports ).
  * LED blinks 10 times to indicate that the wall controller added the associated device successfully.
  * LED blinks 8 times to indicate that the wall controller removed the associated device successfully.  
  
    
  * To remove all associated devices in an association group on the wall controller directly: 
      * Press and hold down “ALL ON/OFF” button on the wall controller for over 3 seconds, LED indicator turns on.
      * Click any Group number button on the wall controller 5 times continuously within 25 seconds to remove all associated devices of this group, LED indicator blinks 8 times to indicate that the associated devices are removed successfully.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the ZV9003T3-RGBW -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|

### Scene Number
Triggers when a scene button is pressed.

The ```scene_number``` channel and is of type ```scene_number``` and supports the ```Number``` item.
This channel provides the scene, and the event as a decimal value in the form ```<scene>.<event>```. The scene number is set by the device, and the event is as follows -:

| Event ID | Event Description  |

## Device Configuration

The device has no configuration parameters defined.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZV9003T3-RGBW supports 4 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Lifeline
  1. Send “Command Class Device Reset Locally” to associated devices of this group to report factory reset information when factory reset the wall controller.
  2. Double click a group number of the wall controller to send command to associated devices of this group using “Command Class Central Scene”.

Association group 1 supports 1 node.
