### Inclusion Information

**Step 1.** Make sure the remote control does not belong to any Z-Wave network, short press on any button, if LED indicator does not turn on, the remote control does not belong to any network, then continue to step 2, if LED indicator turns on, it means the remote control has already been added to a network, please first set the remote control to removing mode (see exclusion information), then continue to step 2.

**Step 2.** Set primary controller/gateway into adding mode.

**Step 3.** Press and hold down both buttons **I** and **O** of Group 2 our 3 seconds, LED indicator, the remote control will be set to adding mode, and waiting to be added, after 10s LED indicator blinks 6 times quickly to indicate successful adding.

### Exclusion Information

There are two removing methods.

**Method 1:** Removing from the primary controller/gateway as follows:

  1. Set the primary controller/gateway into removing mode.
  2. Press and hold down both buttons **I** and **O** of Group 2 over 3 seconds, LED indicator turns on, the remote control will be set to removing mode, and waiting to be removed, after 7s LED indicator blinks 4 times quickly to indicate successful removing.

**Method 2:** Factory reset the remote control will force the remote control to be removed from a network.

A factory reset is done by press and holding down buttons **I** and **O** of Group 2 together for over 10 seconds, LED indicator turns on and then blinks 4 times quickly to indicate successful factory reset.

_Note:_ Factory reset is not recommended for removing, please use this procedure only if the primary controller/gateway is missing or otherwise inoperable.

### Wakeup Information

The Heatit Z-Push Button 8 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


The remote control is under sleepy mode for most of the time to save battery power. It can not receive wireless commands under sleepy mode. Before the gateway interacts data with the remote, the remote control shall be activated manually first. Short press any button to activate the remote control for 3s, and press and hold down **I** and **O** buttons of the Group 2 together over 1 second to activate the remote control for 7s.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the Heatit Z-Push Button 8 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Scene Number | scene_number | scene_number |  | Number | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | system.battery_level | Battery | Number |

### Scene Number
Triggers when a scene button is pressed.

The ```scene_number``` channel is of type ```scene_number``` and supports the ```Number``` item.
This channel provides the scene, and the event as a decimal value in the form ```<scene>.<event>```. The scene number is set by the device, and the event is as follows -:

| Event ID | Event Description  |
|----------|--------------------|
| 0        | Single key press   |
| 1        | Key released       |
| 2        | Key held down      |
| 3        | Double keypress    |
| 4        | Tripple keypress   |
| 5        | 4 x keypress       |
| 6        | 5 x keypress       |

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.


## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 1 configuration parameters available in the Heatit Z-Push Button 8.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | factory reset | factory reset |
|  | Wakeup Interval | Sets the interval at which the device will accept commands from the controller |
|  | Wakeup Node | Sets the node ID of the device to receive the wakeup notifications |

### Parameter 1: factory reset

factory reset

The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | normal operation |
| 21930 | factory reset |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (normal operation).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The Heatit Z-Push Button 8 supports 5 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
  1. Send Command Class "Device Reset Locally Notification V1" to associated devices of the group to report factory reset information when factory reset the remote control.
  2. When remote control battery power value changes, send Command Class "Battery Report V1" to associated devices of this group to report power value information.
  3. Short press or press and hold any button to send scene activation command to the associated devices of this group using Command Class "Central Scene Notification V3".

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.
