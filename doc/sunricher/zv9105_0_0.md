The SRP-ZV9105-24-50CV supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

The LED driver is a Z-Wave device that is used to switch ON/OFF, adjust light intensity of the connected LED light and can be controlled by other Z-Wave devices

### Inclusion Information

1. Set primary controller/gateway into inclusion mode.

2. Power on the LED driver, make sure the LED driver does not belong to any Z-Wave network.

3. When the connected LED light flashes quickly for 6 seconds, it means the LED driver does not belong to any network. Triple press the “Program” button, it will be set into inclusion mode automatically, and waiting to be included.

4. When the connected LED light is under solid on status, it means the LED driver has already been included into a network.

The connected LED light stays solid on 3s to indicate successful inclusion

### Exclusion Information

Exclusion from the primary controller/gateway as follows:

1. Set the primary controller/gateway into exclusion mode

2. Triple press the “Program” button, the LED driver will be set to exclusion mode, the connected LED light will flash quickly for 6 seconds, and waiting to be excluded, then LED light stays solid on 3s to indicate successful exclusion.

There are 3 methods for the LED driver to quit “exclusion mode”. Once the LED driver quits “exclusion mode”, the LED light will stop the fast flash status.

1. Automatically quits after successful exclusion.

2. Quits after 10 seconds timeout.

3. Power off and power on the LED driver.

### General Usage Information

Short press “Program” button on the LED driver to switch ON/OFF the connected LED light.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The SRP-ZV9105-24-50CV supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
1. LED Driver Factory Reset, send Command Class "Device Reset Locally Notification V1" to associated devices of this group to report factory reset information when factory reset the LED driver.

2. When LED driver ON/OFF or light intensity value changes, send Command Class "Basic Report" to associated devices of this group to report ON/OFF or light intensity value information.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.
