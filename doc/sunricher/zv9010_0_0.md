The ZV9010 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The ZV9010 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

The z-wave door window sensor is a wireless, battery powered contact sensor, compatible with the z-wave plus standard. Changing the device's status will automatically send a signal to the z-wave controller and associated devices. The sensor can be used to trigger scenes and wherever there is a need for information about opening or closing of doors, windows, garage doors, etc. Opening is detected by separating the sensor's body and the magnet. 

The encryption modes that the sensor supports are S0, S2 unauthenticated. When the door window sensor is being included into a z-wave network, you can use your primary controller/gateway to enable one encryption mode or disable encryption. (the primary controller/gateway shall support encryption mode configuration

### Inclusion Information

  1. Set primary controller/gateway to inclusion mode
  2. Make sure the sensor does not belong to any z-wave network. Press the action button, if the LED indicator flashes 3 times slowly, it means it does not belong to any network, if the sensor has already been included into a network, it shall be removed form the network first. There are two methods to set the sensor into inclusion mode:   
  
    remove the batteries and install them again to repower the sensor, it will be set into inclusion mode automatically  
    triple press the action button on the sensor, it will set the plug in to inclusion mode.  
  
    
  3. The LED indicator will flash fast then stay solid on for 3 seconds to indicate successful inclusion. if there is no z-wave network available, the LED indicator will flash fast for 6 seconds and sensor will quit inclusion mode automatically.

### Exclusion Information

There are two exclusion methods:

Method 1: exclusion from the primary controller/gateway as follows:

  1. Set the primary controller/gateway into exclusion mode. 
  2. Triple press the action button, the sensor will be set to exclusion mode, the LED indicator will flash fast and then stay solid on for 3 seconds to indicate successful exclusion. If exclusion fails, the LED indicator will flash fast for 6 seconds and the sensor will quit exclusion mode automatically

Method 2: factory reset the sensor will force it to be excluded from a network. 

NOTE: Factory reset is not he recommended for exclusion, please use this procedure only if the primary controller/gateway is missing or otherwise inoperable

### Wakeup Information

The ZV9010 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


Once the sensor in included to a z-wave network, Press and hold down the action button for 3-5 seconds. The LED indicator will flash fast and then stay solid on

### General Usage Information

  * This device contains button lithium batteries that shall be stored and disposed properly
  *  DO NOT expose this device to moisture

**Quick Start**

How to install 

  * step 1: take off the back cover and remove battery protective film and close the cover.
  * step 2: activate inclusion mode on your Z-wave controller
  * step 3: activate inclusion mode of the sensor by triple pressing the action button. The LED indicator will flash fast for 6 seconds then stay solid on for 3 seconds to indicate successful inclusion
  * Step 4: Send a node information Frame by triple pressing the action button on the device. 

**IMPORTANT - NODE INFORMATION FRAME**

The Node Information Frame is the business card of a z-wave device. it contains information about the device type and the technical capabilities. The inclusion and exclusion of the device is confirmed by sending out a Node information Frame. Beside this it may be needed for certain network operations to send out a node information frame.

How to send out Node information frame: 

When the sensor is set to inclusion/exclusion mode again it will send out a node information frame

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the ZV9010 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Alarm (access) | alarm_access | alarm_access | Door | Switch | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | system.battery_level | Battery | Number |

### Alarm (access)
Indicates if the access control alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_access``` channel is of type ```alarm_access``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Door``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.


## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 4 configuration parameters available in the ZV9010.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

0x02, enable to open the door, do not send basic set, enable to close the door, send basic set

0x03, enable to open the door, send basic set, enable to close the door, send basic set
Values in the range 0 to 3 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: Basic_set settings

Basic_set settings
0x01, when the door is opened, send BASIC\_SET=0xFF, when the door is close, send BASIC\_SET=0x00

0x00, when the door is opened, send BASIC\_SET=0x00, when the door is close, send BASIC\_SET=0xFF
Values in the range 0 to 1 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 4: wake up interval

wake up interval
10-1800(30min), unit is seconds. wake up interval (time for the device to enter to sleep mode again after press and hold down the button to wake it up)
Values in the range 10 to 1800 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```10```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_4_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 5: wake up to send battery state

wake up to send battery state
0x01, automatic waking up, send battery power state

0x00, automatic waking up, do not send battery power state
Values in the range 0 to 1 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_5_4``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZV9010 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
  1. when factory reset the sensor, send "device reset locally notification CC" to associated devices of this group to report factory reset information
  2. when the sensor state changes, send "notification CC" to associated devices of this group.
  3. when the battery power is low, send "battery CC" to associated devices of this group

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: On/off Control

On/off Control
When the sensor is turned on/off, send "basic_set". it can be configured by configuration parameter 02 to send BASIC=0xFF(ON), BASIC=0x00(OFF) or disable this function

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.
