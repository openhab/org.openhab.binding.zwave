The ZV2400TAC-SL-A supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

The knob smart dimmer is a Z-Wave device designed to work with various types of light sources. It may be connected to two-wire or three-wire configuration so it can operate with or without neutral lead. The dimmer can switch or dim connected light source either through Z-Wave devices or through the rotary knob directly. The smart dimmer is equipped with an algorithm of smart light source detection which makes configuration easier and ensures high compatibility of the device. It may be used as a switch with non-dimmable light sources (in 3- wire connection). The dimmer can be included and operated in any Z-Wave network with other Z-Wave certified devices from other manufacturers and/or other applications. All non-battery operated nodes within the network will act as repeaters regardless of vendor to increase reliability of the network. The encryption mode that the dimmer supports is S2 Unauthenticated. When the dimmer is being included into a Z-Wave network, you can use your primary controller/gateway to enable encryption mode or disable encryption. (The primary controller/gateway shall support encryption mode configuration). The dimmer supports OTA and can update firmware wirelessly.

### Inclusion Information

There are two methods to set the dimmer into inclusion mode:

  1. Repower on the dimmer, it will be set into inclusion mode automatically, and waiting to be included.
  2. Triple press reset button on the dimmer, it will set the dimmer into inclusion mode. The connected light will stay solid on for 3 seconds to indicate successful inclusion.

### Exclusion Information

There are two exclusion methods:

Method 1: Exclusion from the primary controller/gateway as follows:

  1. Set the primary controller/gateway into exclusion mode (Please refer to your primary controllers manual on how to set your controller into exclusion).
  2. Triple press reset button, the dimmer will be set to exclusion mode, and waiting to be excluded, then the dimmer will be excluded from the network.

Method 2: Factory reset the dimmer will force it to be excluded from a network. (please refer to the part “Factory Reset” of this manual) Note: Factory reset is not recommended for exclusion, please use this procedure only if the primary controller/gateway is missing or otherwise inoperable.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZV2400TAC-SL-A supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
1. When press and hold down “Reset” button for 10S to reset the dimmer, send "Device Reset Locally Notification CC" to associated devices of this group to report factory reset information.

2. When load state changes, send "Basic Report CC" to associated devices of this group.

3. When a load over current is detected, send "Over-current detected" to Lifeline.

4. When a mains voltage drop is detected, send "Voltage drop/drift" to Lifeline.

5. When over temperature is detected, send “Emergency shutoff status" to Lifeline.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.
