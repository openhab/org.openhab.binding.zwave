## Overview

<p&gtSR-ZV9001T4-DIM-EU is a touch control z-wave secondary controller (z wave dimmer switch) with z-wave Plus enabled for single color LED lighting.</p&gt <p&gtAs a z-wave secondary controller, it is a z wave dimmer switch which can be added to z-wave network and removed from z-wave network by z-wave primary (master) controllers or gateway and control z-wave devices that are added to the network. It supports 5 groups for associations, a lifeline group association to primary (master) controller and 4 groups association to devices, the group association to devices supports maximum 12 Z-wave devices per group.</p&gt <p&gtIt is a universal z-wave slave which can be compatible with universal z-wave primary controller or gateway. The wireless controller is compatible with single color z wave device SR-ZV9101FA-DIM and different frequencies are available for different countries or areas. The signal transmit distance can be up to 30m. The controller supports group and scene storage and recall functions. It is easy to install on the wall and available in standard EU size.</p&gt <p&gt<strong&gtKey Features</strong&gt</p&gt <ul&gt<li&gtSingle color touch Z-wave secondary controller</li&gt <li&gtSource-routed Mesh Network Architecture</li&gt <li&gtEach device works as a node</li&gt <li&gtAll Nodes Are Transceivers</li&gt <li&gtEach Z-wave Network Allows Up to 243 Devices</li&gt <li&gtActively route around and circumvent obstacles or radio dead spots</li&gt <li&gtWireless Synchronization to Drastically Increase Control Distance</li&gt <li&gtDevices can communicate to one another by using intermediate nodes</li&gt <li&gtAdded or removed by primary controllers or gateway</li&gt <li&gtSupports 1 lifeline group association to master controller</li&gt <li&gtSupports 4 groups association to z-wave devices, maximum 12 devices per group</li&gt <li&gtCompatible with universal z-wave primary controller or gateway</li&gt <li&gtSupports group, scene storage and recall functions</li&gt </ul&gt

### Inclusion Information

<p&gtSet z-wave master (primary) controller into network inclusion mode (please refer to their manual to learn how)   Click the “Inclusion/Exclusion” key on the back of the slave controller (or press and hold down the switch key ) -> LED indicator on the salve controller turns on and flashes 6 times quickly to indicate successful adding -> there shall be an indication on master controller or z-wave gateway</p&gt

### Exclusion Information

<p&gtWhen the slave controller has already been added to z-wave network, set the z-wave master controller or z-wave gateway into network exclusion mode (please refer to their user manual to learn how)</p&gt <p&gtClick the “Inclusion/Exclusion” key on the back of the slave controller (or press and hold down the switch key )</p&gt <p&gt-> LED indicator on the slave controller turns on and shows 3 short blinks and 1 long blink to indicate successful removing</p&gt <p&gt-> there shall be an indication on the master controller</p&gt

## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 2 configuration parameters available in the ZV9001T4-DIM.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 3 | Scene_type | Scene type |
| 4 | Scene_send_to_where | Scene send to where |

### Parameter 3: Scene_type

Scene type
<p&gtParameter 3 can be configured via “COMMAND\_CLASS\_CONFIGURATION” to decide which scene command to use “CENTRAL SCENE” or “SCENE ACTIVATION”, factory default is “CENTRAL SCENE”.</p&gt
Values in the range 0 to 1 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 4: Scene_send_to_where

Scene send to where
Parameter 4 can be configured via “COMMAND\_CLASS\_CONFIGURATION” to decide which object shall the remote send scene packet to, the gateway or the association group. Factory default is the association group.   By factory default this remote uses “CENTRAL SCENE” to send packet to the association group devices, this method requires that the controlled devices support “CENTRAL SCENE”
Values in the range 0 to 1 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_4_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZV9001T4-DIM supports 5 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Group 2
