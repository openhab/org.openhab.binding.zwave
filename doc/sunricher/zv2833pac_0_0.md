The ZV2833PAC supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

This device converts the switches to wireless Z-Wave signal, the coupler can both control other Z-Wave devices and activate scenes in Gateways. The push-button coupler can be included and operated in any Z-Wave network with other Z-Wave certified devices from other manufacturers and/or other applications. All non-battery operated nodes within the network will act as repeaters regardless of vendor to increase reliability of the network.

Although it is controlling other devices, the device cannot act as Z-Wave network controller (primary or secondary) and will always need a Z-Wave network controller to be included into a Z-Wave network. It also supports the Over The Air (OTA) feature for the product’s firmware upgrade.

This device supports the SmartStart inclusion. SmartStart enabled products can be added into a Z-Wave network by scanning the Z-Wave QR Code present on the product with a controller providing SmartStart inclusion. No further action is required and the SmartStart product will be added automatically within 10 minutes of being switched on in the network vicinity.

The push-button coupler has following functions:

  1. Control of other Z-Wave devices using 'ON', 'OFF', Dim commands.
  2. Activation of scenes in Gateway mode.

The encryption modes that the push-button coupler supports are S0, S2 Authenticated, S2 Unauthenticated. When the coupler is being included into a Z-Wave network, you can use your primary controller/gateway to enable one encryption mode or disable encryption. (The primary controller/gateway shall support encryption mode configuration).

### Inclusion Information

Step 1. Make sure the push-button coupler does not belong to any Z-Wave network, short press any button, if LED indicator flashes 3 times slowly, the coupler does not belong to any network, then continue step 2, otherwise, it means the coupler has already been included to a network, please first set the coupler to exclusion mode (refer to the part "Exclusion" of this manual),then continue step 2.

Step 2. Set primary controller/gateway into inclusion mode (Please refer to your primary controllers manual on how to turn your controller into inclusion).

Step 3. Set the coupler to inclusion mode, there are two methods as follows:

  1. Triple press the “reset” button, the coupler will be set to inclusion mode, and waiting to be included.
  2. Power off and power on the coupler, it will be set to inclusion mode, and waiting to be included.

The coupler is a sleepy device, after inclusion it will not enter into sleepy mode immediately, and will continue activation status for 10s and wait data interaction from the gateway, the LED indicator will flash quickly, please be patient to wait LED indicator to turn off.

### Exclusion Information

There are two exclusion methods:

Method 1: Exclusion from the primary controller/gateway as follows:

  1. Set the primary controller/gateway into exclusion mode (Please refer to your primary controllers manual on how to set your controller into exclusion).
  2. Triple press the “reset” button, the coupler will be set to exclusion mode, and waiting to be excluded.

Method 2: Factory reset the coupler will force it to be excluded from a network. (please refer to the part “Factory Reset” of this manual)

Note: Factory reset is not recommended for exclusion,

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZV2833PAC supports 5 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

2. Short press once or twice, press and hold down, release the any of connected switch buttons K1, K2, K3, K4 to send scene activation command to the associated devices of this group using Command Class “Central Scene”. The actions of each switch button that trigger central scene can be configured via parameters 5-8.
