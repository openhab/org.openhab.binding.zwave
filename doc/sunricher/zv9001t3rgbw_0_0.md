## Overview

<h1&gt<strong&gtProduct Description </strong&gt</h1&gt <p&gtThe Wall controller is a Security Enabled Z-Wave Plus device that can both control other Z-Wave devices and activate scenes in Gateways. The wall controller can be included and operated in any Z-Wave network with other Z-Wave certified devices from other manufacturers and/or other applications. All non-battery operated nodes within the network will act as repeaters regardless of vendor to increase reliability of the network.</p&gt <p&gtAlthough it is controlling other devices, the device cannot act as Z-Wave network controller (primary or secondary), so a security enabled controller is needed for take full advantage of all functionally for the device. It also supports the Over The Air (OTA) feature for the product’s firmware upgrade. The wall controller has following functions:</p&gt <ol&gt<li&gtControl of groups of other Z-Wave devices using 'ON', 'OFF', Dim and Color Control commands.</li&gt <li&gtActivation of scenes in Gateways.</li&gt </ol&gt<p&gtThe encryption modes that the wall controller supports are S0, S2 Unauthenticated. When the wall controller is being included into a Z-Wave network, you can use your primary controller/gateway to enable one encryption mode or disable encryption. (The primary controller/gateway shall support encryption mode configuration).</p&gt <h1&gtProduct Data</h1&gt <table&gt<tr&gt<td&gtZ-Wave Frequency</td&gt <td&gt908.42 MHz (US)</td&gt </tr&gt<tr&gt<td&gtPower Supply</td&gt <td&gt100-240VAC, 50/60Hz</td&gt </tr&gt<tr&gt<td&gtPower Consumption</td&gt <td&gt< 0.5W</td&gt </tr&gt<tr&gt<td&gtOperating temperature</td&gt <td&gt0 to 40°C</td&gt </tr&gt<tr&gt<td&gtRelative humidity</td&gt <td&gt8% to 80%</td&gt </tr&gt<tr&gt<td&gtDimensions</td&gt <td&gt75mm x 120mm x 29.1mm</td&gt </tr&gt<tr&gt<td&gtMaterial</td&gt <td&gtTempered glass panel with capacitive touch buttons </td&gt </tr&gt</table&gt<h1&gtInstallation Guide</h1&gt <p&gtPlease read carefully the enclosed user manual before installation of wall controller, in order to ensure an error-free functioning.</p&gt <p&gtThe wall controller unit supplied as complete set for flush mounting in the standard US size wall boxes.</p&gt <p&gt<strong&gtATTENTION</strong&gt: Only authorized technicians under consideration of the country specific installation guidelines/norms may do works with 100-240V mains power. Prior to the assembly of the product, the voltage network has to be switched OFF and ensured against re-switching.</p&gt

### Inclusion Information

<h1&gtInclusion (Add the device to a Z-Wave network)</h1&gt <ol&gt<li&gtSet primary controller/gateway into inclusion mode (Please refer to your primary controllers manual on how to turn your controller into inclusion).</li&gt <li&gtMake sure the wall controller does not belong to any Z-Wave network (please refer to the part “How to check whether the wall controller included to a network” of this manual).</li&gt <li&gtShort press the “inclusion/exclusion” button, or press and hold down “ALL ON/OFF” button for over 3 seconds, the wall controller will be set to inclusion mode, and waiting to be included, then LED indicator turns on and blinks 6 times quickly to indicate successful inclusion.</li&gt </ol&gt<p&gtOnce the wall controller quits “inclusion mode”, the LED indicator will turns off. There are 3 ways for wall controller to complete “inclusion mode”:</p&gt <ol&gt<li&gtAutomatically quits after successful inclusion.</li&gt <li&gtQuits after 25 seconds timeout.</li&gt <li&gtPress and hold down “ALL ON/OFF” button for over 3 seconds, or short press the “inclusion/exclusion” button to quit.</li&gt </ol&gt

### Exclusion Information

<h1&gtExclusion (Remove the device from a Z-Wave network)</h1&gt <p&gtThere are two exclusion methods:</p&gt <h2&gtMethod 1: Exclusion from the primary controller/gateway:</h2&gt <ol&gt<li&gtSet the primary controller/gateway into exclusion mode (Please refer to your primary controllers manual on how to set your controller into exclusion).</li&gt <li&gtShort press the “inclusion/exclusion” button, or press and hold down “ALL ON/OFF” button for over 3 seconds, the wall controller will be set to exclusion mode, and waiting to be excluded, then LED indicator turns on and shows 3 short blinks and 1 long blink to indicate successful exclusion.</li&gt </ol&gt<p&gtOnce the wall controller quits “exclusion mode”, the LED indicator will turns off.</p&gt <p&gtThere are 3 ways for the wall controller to quit “exclusion mode”:</p&gt <ol&gt<li&gtAutomatically quits after successful exclusion.</li&gt <li&gtQuits after 25 seconds timeout.</li&gt <li&gtPress and hold down “ALL ON/OFF” button for over 3 seconds, or short press the “inclusion/exclusion” button to quit.</li&gt </ol&gt<h2&gtMethod 2: Factory reset the wall controller will force the wall controller to be excluded from a network. (please refer to the part “Factory Reset” of this manual)</h2&gt <p&gt<strong&gtNote</strong&gt: Factory reset is not recommended for exclusion, please use this procedure only if the primary controller/gateway is missing or otherwise inoperable.</p&gt

## Device Configuration

The device has no configuration parameters defined.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZV9001T3-RGBW supports 4 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Association group for commands to Z-Wave network controller
<ol&gt<li&gtSend “Command Class Device Reset Locally” to associated devices of this group to report factory reset information when factory reset the wall controller.</li&gt <li&gtDouble click a group number of the wall controller to send command to associated devices of this group using “Command Class Central Scene”.</li&gt </ol&gt

Association group 1 supports 1 node.
