The 4512715 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
1. When press and hold down "Reset" button to factory reset the switch, send "Device Reset Locally Notification CC" to associated devices of this group.

2. When laod state changes, send "Basic Report CC" to associated devices of this group.

3. When over temperature protections is detected, send "Emergency shutoff status" to Lifeline.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.
