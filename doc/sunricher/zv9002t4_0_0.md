## Overview

<p&gtSR-ZV9002T4-CCT-EU is a touch control Z-Wave Plus certified wall controller for dual color LED Lighting. As a z-wave secondary controller,<br /&gt it is a z wave light switch which can be added to z-wave network and removed from z-wave network by z-wave primary (master) controllers<br /&gt or gateway and control z-wave devices that are added to the network It supports 5 groups for associations, a lifeline group association to<br /&gt primary (master) controller and 4 groups association to devices, the group association to devices supports maximum 12 Z-wave devices per group.</p&gt <p&gtIt is a universal z-wave slave which can be compatible with universal z-wave primary controller or gateway. The wireless controller is compatible with dual color z wave device SR-ZV9102FA-CCT and different frequencies are available for different countries or areas. The signal transmit distance can be up to 30m. The controller supports group and scene storage and recall functions.</p&gt <p&gtThe controller is easy to install on the wall and available in standard EU size.</p&gt <p&gt<strong&gtKey Features</strong&gt</p&gt <ul&gt<li&gtZ-Wave Plus certified</li&gt <li&gtTouch panel dual color Z-Wave wall controller</li&gt <li&gtSource-routed Mesh Network Architecture</li&gt <li&gtEach device works as a node</li&gt <li&gtAll Nodes Are Transceivers</li&gt <li&gtEach Z-wave Network Allows Up to 232 Devices</li&gt <li&gtActively route around and circumvent obstacles or radio dead spots</li&gt <li&gtWireless Synchronization to Drastically Increase Control Distance</li&gt <li&gtDevices can communicate to one another by using intermediate nodes</li&gt <li&gtAdded or removed by primary controllers or gateway</li&gt <li&gtSupports 1 lifeline group association to master controller</li&gt <li&gtSupports 4 groups association to z-wave devices, maximum 12 devices per group</li&gt <li&gtCompatible with universal z-wave primary controller or gateway</li&gt <li&gtSupports group, scene storage and recall functions</li&gt </ul&gt

### Inclusion Information

<p&gtInclusion (Add the device to a Z-Wave network):</p&gt <ol&gt<li&gtSet primary controller/gateway into inclusion mode (Please refer to your primary controllers manual on how to turn your controller into inclusion).</li&gt <li&gtMake sure the wall controller does not belong to any Z-Wave network (please refer to the part “How to check whether the wall controller included to a network” of this manual).</li&gt <li&gtShort press the “inclusion/exclusion” button, or press and hold down “ALL ON/OFF” button for over 3 seconds, the wall controller will be set to inclusion mode, and waiting to be included, then LED indicator turns on and blinks 6 times quickly to indicate successful inclusion.</li&gt </ol&gt<p&gtOnce the wall controller quits “inclusion mode”, the LED indicator will turns off. There are 3 methods for the wall controller to quit “inclusion mode”:</p&gt <ol&gt<li&gtAutomatically quits after successful inclusion.</li&gt <li&gtQuits after 25 seconds timeout.</li&gt <li&gtPress and hold down “ALL ON/OFF” button for over 3 seconds, or short press the “inclusion/exclusion” button to quit.</li&gt </ol&gt

### Exclusion Information

<p&gtExclusion (Remove the device from a Z-Wave network) There are two exclusion methods:</p&gt <p&gt<strong&gtMethod 1:</strong&gt Exclusion from the primary controller/gateway as follows:</p&gt <ol&gt<li&gtSet the primary controller/gateway into exclusion mode (Please refer to your primary controllers manual on how to set your controller into exclusion).</li&gt <li&gtShort press the “inclusion/exclusion” button, or press and hold down “ALL ON/OFF” button for over 3 seconds, the wall controller will be set to exclusion mode, and waiting to be excluded, then LED indicator turns on and shows 3 short blinks and 1 long blink to indicate successful exclusion.</li&gt </ol&gt<p&gtOnce the wall controller quits “exclusion mode”, the LED indicator will turns off. There are 3 methods for the wall controller to quit “exclusion mode”:</p&gt <ol&gt<li&gtAutomatically quits after successful exclusion.</li&gt <li&gtQuits after 25 seconds timeout.</li&gt <li&gtPress and hold down “ALL ON/OFF” button for over 3 seconds, or short press the “inclusion/exclusion” button to quit.</li&gt </ol&gt<p&gt<strong&gtMethod 2:</strong&gt Factory reset the wall controller will force the wall controller to be excluded from a network. (please refer to the part “Factory Reset” of this manual)Note:</p&gt <p&gtFactory reset is not recommended for exclusion, please use this procedure only if the primary controller/gateway is missing or otherwise inoperable.</p&gt <p&gt<strong&gtHow to check whether the wall controller already included to a network</strong&gt<br /&gtOperate any button to check if there is indication from the LED indicator, and no LED indication means the wall controller does not belong to any network. If the wall controller already belongs to a network, follow the exclusion process before including it in your network. Otherwise inclusion of this device will fail.</p&gt <p&gt<strong&gtFactory Reset</strong&gt<br /&gtPress and hold down “inclusion/exclusion” button for over 8 seconds, LED indicator will blink slowly to indicate successful factory reset, release “inclusion/exclusion” button, the wall controller will restart automatically. If this controller is the primary controller for your network, resetting it will result in the nodes in your network being orphaned and it will be necessary after the reset to exclude and re-include all of the nodes in the network. If this controller is being used as a secondary controller in the network, use this procedure to reset this controller only in the event that the network primary controller is missing or otherwise inoperable.</p&gt

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the ZV9002T4-CCT -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Scene Number | scene_number | scene_number |  | Number | 

### Scene Number
Triggers when a scene button is pressed.

The ```scene_number``` channel is of type ```scene_number``` and supports the ```Number``` item.
This channel provides the scene, and the event as a decimal value in the form ```<scene>.<event>```. The scene number is set by the device, and the event is as follows -:

## Device Configuration

The device has no configuration parameters defined.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZV9002T4-CCT supports 5 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
<ol&gt<li&gtSend “Command Class Device Reset Locally” to associated devices of this group to report factory reset information when factory reset the wall controller.</li&gt <li&gtDouble click a group number of the wall controller to send command to associated devices of this group using “Command Class Central Scene”.</li&gt </ol&gt

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Launch 1

<ol&gt<li&gtPress and hold down button "1" to activate group in order to switch the associated devices with a Basic Set or dim these devices by using the two brightness buttons or adjust color temperature by using color wheel.</li&gt <li&gtShort press Scene button S1/S2/S3/S4, direct control of associated devices using Scene Activation Set, Scene ID = 0x10 / 0x20 / 0x30 / 0x40.</li&gt <li&gtPress and hold down Scene button S1/S2/S3/S4, direct control of associated devices using Scene Conf Set, Scene ID = 0x10 / 0x20 / 0x30 / 0x40.</li&gt </ol&gt
