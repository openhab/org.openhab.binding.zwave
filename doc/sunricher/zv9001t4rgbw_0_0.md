## Overview

<p&gtSR-ZV9001T4-RGBW-EU is a touch panel Z-Wave Plus certified wall controller for RGBW LED lighting. As a z-wave secondary controller, it can be added to z-wave network and removed from z-wave network by z-wave primary (master) controllers or gateway and control z-wave devices that are added to the network.</p&gt <p&gtIt supports 5 groups for associations, a lifeline group association to primary (master) controller and 4 groups association to devices, the groups association to devices support maximum 5 Z-wave devices per group. 20 built-in color changing effects are available with changing speed adjustable.</p&gt <p&gtIt is a universal z-wave slave which can be compatible with universal z-wave primary controller or gateway. The wireless controller is compatible with RGBW z wave device SR-ZV9103FA-RGBW and different frequencies are available for different countries or areas. The signal transmit distance can be up to 30m. The controller is easy to install on the wall and available in standard EU size.</p&gt <p&gt<strong&gtKey Features</strong&gt</p&gt <ul&gt<li&gtZ-Wave Plus certified</li&gt <li&gtTouch Panel RGBW Z-Wave Wall Controller</li&gt <li&gtSource-routed Mesh Network Architecture</li&gt <li&gtEach device works as a node</li&gt <li&gtAll Nodes Are Transceivers</li&gt <li&gtEach Z-wave Network Allows Up to 232 Devices</li&gt <li&gtActively route around and circumvent obstacles or radio dead spots</li&gt <li&gtWireless Synchronization to Drastically Increase Control Distance</li&gt <li&gtDevices can communicate to one another by using intermediate nodes</li&gt <li&gtAdded or removed by primary controllers or gateway</li&gt <li&gtSupports 1 lifeline group association to master controller</li&gt <li&gtSupports 4 groups association to z-wave devices, maximum 5 devices per group</li&gt <li&gt20 built-in color changing effects are available with changing speed adjustable</li&gt <li&gtCompatible with universal z-wave primary controller or gateway</li&gt </ul&gt

### Inclusion Information

<p&gtInclusion:</p&gt <ol&gt<li&gtSet primary controller/gateway into inclusion mode (Please refer to your primary controllers manual on how to turn your controller into inclusion).</li&gt <li&gtMake sure the wall controller does not belong to any Z-Wave network (please refer to the part “How to check whether the wall controller included to a network” of this manual).</li&gt <li&gtShort press the “inclusion/exclusion” button, or press and hold down “ALL ON/OFF” button for over 3 seconds, the wall controller will be set to inclusion mode, and waiting to be included, then LED indicator turns on and blinks 6 times quickly to indicate successful inclusion. Once the wall controller quits “inclusion mode”, the LED indicator will turns off.</li&gt </ol&gt<p&gtThere are 3 methods for the wall controller to quit “inclusion mode”:</p&gt <ol&gt<li&gtAutomatically quits after successful inclusion.</li&gt <li&gtQuits after 25 seconds timeout.</li&gt <li&gtPress and hold down “ALL ON/OFF” button for over 3 seconds, or short press the “inclusion/exclusion” button to quit.</li&gt </ol&gt

### Exclusion Information

<p&gtThere are two exclusion methods:</p&gt <p&gt<strong&gtMethod 1: Exclusion from the primary controller/gateway as follows:</strong&gt</p&gt <ol&gt<li&gtSet the primary controller/gateway into exclusion mode (Please refer to your primary controllers manual on how to set your controller into exclusion).</li&gt <li&gtShort press the “inclusion/exclusion” button, or press and hold down “ALL ON/OFF” button for over 3 seconds, the wall controller will be set to exclusion mode, and waiting to be excluded, then LED indicator turns on and shows 3 short blinks and 1 long blink to indicate successful exclusion.</li&gt </ol&gt<p&gtOnce the wall controller quits “exclusion mode”, the LED indicator will turns off.</p&gt <p&gtThere are 3 methods for the wall controller to quit “exclusion mode”:</p&gt <ol&gt<li&gtAutomatically quits after successful exclusion.</li&gt <li&gtQuits after 25 seconds timeout.</li&gt <li&gtPress and hold down “ALL ON/OFF” button for over 3 seconds, or short press the “inclusion/exclusion” button to quit.</li&gt </ol&gt<p&gt<strong&gtMethod 2: Factory reset</strong&gt the wall controller will force the wall controller to be excluded from a network. Please refer to the part “Factory Reset” of the manual.</p&gt

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the ZV9001T4-RGBW -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Scene Number | scene_number | scene_number |  | Number | 

### Scene Number
Triggers when a scene button is pressed.

The ```scene_number``` channel is of type ```scene_number``` and supports the ```Number``` item.
This channel provides the scene, and the event as a decimal value in the form ```<scene>.<event>```. The scene number is set by the device, and the event is as follows -:

| Event ID | Event Description  |
|----------|--------------------|
| 0        | Single key press   |
| 1        | Key released       |
| 2        | Key held down      |
| 3        | Double keypress    |
| 4        | Tripple keypress   |
| 5        | 4 x keypress       |
| 6        | 5 x keypress       |



## Device Configuration

The device has no configuration parameters defined.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZV9001T4-RGBW supports 5 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
<ol&gt<li&gtSend “Command Class Device Reset Locally” to associated devices of this group to report factory reset information when factory reset the wall controller.</li&gt <li&gtDouble click a group number of the wall controller to send command to associated devices of this group using “Command Class Central Scene”.</li&gt </ol&gt

Association group 1 supports 1 node.
