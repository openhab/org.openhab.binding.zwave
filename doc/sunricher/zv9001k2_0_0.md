The SR-ZV9001K2-Dim supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The SR-ZV9001K2-Dim does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

The remote control is a Z-Wave device that can both control other Z-Wave devices and activate scenes in Gateways. Although it is controlling other devices, the device cannot act as Z-Wave network controller (primary or secondary) and will always need a Z-Wave network controller to be included into a Z-Wave network. It also supports the Over The Air (OTA) feature for the product’s firmware upgrade.

The remote control has following functions:

  1. Control of groups of other Z-Wave devices using 'ON', 'OFF' and Dim commands.
  2. Activation of scenes in Gateway mode. 

The encryption modes that the remote control supports are S0, S2 Authenticated, S2 Unauthenticated. When the remote control is being included into a Z-Wave network, you can use your primary controller/gateway to enable one encryption mode or disable encryption. (The primary controller/gateway shall support encryption mode configuration).

### Inclusion Information

Step 1.  
Make sure the remote control does not belong to any Z-Wave network, short press any button, if LED indicator does not turn on, the remote control does not belong to any network, then continue step 2,if LED indicator turns on, it means the remote control has already been included to a network, please first set the remote control to exclusion mode (refer to the part "Exclusion" of this manual),then continue step 2.

Step 2.  
Set primary controller/gateway into inclusion mode (Please refer to your primary controllers manual on how to turn your controller into inclusion).

Step 3.  
Press and hold down both and buttons over 3 seconds, LED indicator turns on, the remote control will be set to inclusion mode, and waiting to be included, after 10s LED indicator blinks 6 times quickly to indicate successful inclusion. The remote control is a sleepy device, after inclusion it will not enter into sleepy mode immediately, and will continue activation status for 30s and wait data interaction from the gateway, the LED indicator will stay solid on, please be patient to wait LED indicator to turn off.

### Exclusion Information

There are two exclusion methods:

Method 1:  
Exclusion from the primary controller/gateway as follows:

  1. Set the primary controller/gateway into exclusion mode (Please refer to your primary controllers manual on how to set your controller into exclusion).
  2. Press and hold down both and buttons over 3 seconds, LED indicator turns on, the remote control will be set to exclusion mode, and waiting to be excluded, after 7s LED indicator blinks 4 times quickly to indicate successful exclusion.

Method 2:  
Factory reset the remote control will force the remote control to be excluded from a network. (please refer to the part “Factory Reset” of this manual)

Note: Factory reset is not recommended for exclusion, please use this procedure only if the primary controller/gateway is missing or otherwise inoperable.

### Wakeup Information

The SR-ZV9001K2-Dim does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


How to send out Node Information Frame:  
Press and hold down both ON and OFF buttons over 3 seconds, LED indicator turns on to indicate the wall controller has already sent out Node Information Frame, the user can repeat the operation to set the wall controller to quit “inclusion/exclusion mode”.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the SR-ZV9001K2-Dim -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Dimmer | switch_dimmer | switch_dimmer | DimmableLight | Dimmer | 
| Scene Number | scene_number | scene_number |  | Number | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | system.battery_level | Battery | Number |

### Dimmer
The brightness channel allows to control the brightness of a light.
            It is also possible to switch the light on and off.

The ```switch_dimmer``` channel is of type ```switch_dimmer``` and supports the ```Dimmer``` item and is in the ```DimmableLight``` category.

### Scene Number
Triggers when a scene button is pressed.

The ```scene_number``` channel is of type ```scene_number``` and supports the ```Number``` item.
This channel provides the scene, and the event as a decimal value in the form ```<scene>.<event>```. The scene number is set by the device, and the event is as follows -:

| Event ID | Event Description  |
|----------|--------------------|
| 0        | Single key press   |
| 1        | Key released       |
| 2        | Key held down      |
| 3        | Double keypress    |
| 4        | Tripple keypress   |
| 5        | 4 x keypress       |
| 6        | 5 x keypress       |

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.


## Device Configuration

The device has no configuration parameters defined.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The SR-ZV9001K2-Dim supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
1. Send Command Class "Device Reset Locally Notification V1" to  
associated devices of this group to report factory reset information  
when factory reset the remote control.  
2. When remote control battery power value changes, send  
Command Class "Battery Report V1" to associated devices of this  
group to report power value information.  
3. Short press or press and hold down any button to send scene  
activation command to the associated devices of this group using  
Command Class “Central Scene Notification V3”

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Launch 1

Short press | / O button of Group 2 to send ON/OFF command to  
associated devices of this group using Command Class "Basic Set  
V2".

  
Press and hold down | / O button of Group 2 to send light intensity  
increase/decrease command to associated devices of this group  
using Command Class "Multilevel V4".

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.
