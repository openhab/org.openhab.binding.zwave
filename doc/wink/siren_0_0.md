The Siren supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

## Overview

The Wink Siren is a Z-Wave Plus battery-powered device that will sound an alarm, chime, and flash a built-in light to let you know when doors and windows open or when motion is detected in your home. The siren’s multi-purpose functionality of an alarm siren, doorbell, or chime notification can be turned on and off manually or automatically from your smartphone using a Wink Hub or other Z-Wave Plus certified hub.  
  
The Wink Siren offers ten user selectable sounds for alarm and chime, with three volume levels (up to 105dB) and adjustable siren duration timeout. Additional visual notification is provided by built-in flashing blue LEDs when triggered.  
  
The Wink Siren offers an extra-long z-wave wireless range of up to 150 feet, so you can place it in your home where it’s needed, and requires a Wink Hub or other Z-Wave Plus certified hub for operation. The siren comes with two CR123A 3.0V batteries and has a three-year battery life, and will send an alert to your smartphone when the device has low battery.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the Siren -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Switch | switch_binary | switch_binary | Switch | Switch | 
| Alarm | alarm_general | alarm_general | Alarm | Switch | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | system.battery_level | Battery | Number |

### Switch
Switch the power on and off.

The ```switch_binary``` channel is of type ```switch_binary``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Switch``` category.

### Alarm
Indicates if an alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_general``` channel is of type ```alarm_general``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Alarm``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The Siren supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Group 1 is the “Lifeline” group, which can hold five members, typically including the main Z-Wave controller. The Siren sends this group a Notification Report and a Binary Switch Report when the siren is turned on or off. It also sends this group a Batter

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Group 2

Group 2 can hold five members, and the Siren sends a single command to this Association Group, the Binary Switch Report, whenever the Siren is turned on or off

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Group 3

Group 2 can hold five members, and the Siren sends a single command to this Association Group, a Notification Report, whenever the Siren is turned on or off

Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.
