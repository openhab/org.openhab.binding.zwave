| 8 | Time switch enable/disable | Defines switch timer function Enable/Disable (default Disable). |
| 9 | Time switch period | Defines the time period before the plug is switched off (default 150m). |

### Parameter 1: Send meter report enable

This parameter defines Enable/Disable meter report measure data to controller (default Enable).

The following option values may be configured, in addition to values in the range 0 to 0 -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Disable |
| 1 | Enable |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (Enable).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Meter report interval

Defines the time interval that meter report data to main controller (default 300s).

Values in the range 1 to 65535 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```300```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: Upper current threshold

Defines the maximum current before the plug will cut off power (default 13A).
This parameter defines maximum current the plug can provide to load that be connected to plug. If the current consumed by load greater than maximum current, the plug will cut off power.
Values in the range 1 to 16 may be set.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_7_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 8: Time switch enable/disable

Defines switch timer function Enable/Disable (default Disable).
This parameter defines the timer function Enable/Disable. The time period will be defined in parameter #9. If this parameter is set to 1, and when turn the plug relay on, the timer in plug start run with time period defined in parameter #9 and the plug will turn the relay off.

| 0 | Disable |
| 1 | Enable |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Disable).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_8_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 9: Time switch period

Defines the time period before the plug is switched off (default 150m).
This parameter defines the time period that plug time switch off.

If Parameter #8 is set to 1, and relay is turn-on, the relay will be turn-off after delay this parameter.
Values in the range 1 to 65535 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```150```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_9_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZPR-111 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 1 node.
