The TZ45 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

The Z-Wave thermostat provides for typical thermostat control of a central heating and cooling HVAC system plus has the added feature of Z-Wave communications for remote control.

The thermostat has a large, backlit graphical display, control buttons, status LEDs and a temperature sensor. The thermostat can display multiple screens for different functions of the thermostat. The default thermostat control screen shown below, will display the current room temperature, heating and cooling setpoints, system mode, manual-fan mode, time, and status information. 

### Inclusion Information

General Programming Procedure (for controllers supporting the thermostat device class): 1. Set your primary controller to Include mode, to add the thermostat as a node on your network (see your controller’s user manual for detailed instructions). 2. In the Thermostat’s Main Menu, scroll down to the ZWave Install item. Select the item. 3. Press the YES button in the ZWave Install screen.
