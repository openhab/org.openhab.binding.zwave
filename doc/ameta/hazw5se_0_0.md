The HA-ZW-5SE supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The HA-ZW-5SE does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

### Wakeup Information

The HA-ZW-5SE does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


  1. Short press 3 time.
  2. LED will blink one time; sending wake up notification cc

### General Usage Information

FACTORY RESET

Press and hold for 5 seconds.

LED will blink fast for 5 seconds and then keep solid for 3 seconds, after that Door/Window Sensor will send “Device\_Reset\_Locally” to the main controller and exclude from the Z-Wave network.

Please use this procedure only when the network primary controller is missing or otherwise inoperable.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The HA-ZW-5SE supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Group 1

  1. Notification Report.  
    Sensor will send Notification Report when the supported event is triggered.
  2. Battery Report.  
    Sensor will send Battery Report when the battery level is low and the battery report’s value is 0xFF.
  3. Device Reset Locally.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Group 2

Basic Set, Sensor will send Basic Set when the sensor body and magnet removed or combined.

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.
