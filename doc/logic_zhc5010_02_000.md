# ZHC5010 FUGA Wall 4-way Switch with LED + Relay

This describes the Z-Wave device *ZHC5010*, manufactured by *Logic Home Control* with the thing type UID of ```logic_zhc5010_02_000```. 

FUGA Wall 4-way Switch with LED + Relay  


## Overview 

ZHC5010 is a wall switch module with Z-Wave communication. The module contains four buttons, four LEDs, a built-in relay switch and is designed to fit into a standard LK FUGA® wall box (one-module format). The ZHC5010 Wall Switch allows you to control the local load as well as Z-Wave connected devices in up to four additional Z-Wave groups.

Configuration updated: 2017-12-10, firmware 2.03

  


### Inclusion Information 

Place your primary controller in Adding Mode by following the manufacturer's instructions, then activate the add mode on the device by triple-clicking the upper left button on the module, or by triple-clicking the little button in the middle of the module (hidden behind the small plastic cover). Adding Mode is indicated by blinking of upper left LED until the timeout occurs after 10 seconds or the module has been added in the network. 

  


### Exclusion Information 

Follow the inclusion procedures; the device is removed in the same manner, when the controller is in Removing Mode.

Factory reset:

ZHC5010 can be factory reset by pressing the small button in the middle of the module (normally covered by small plastic cover) for at least 10 seconds. Remove the middle plastic cover by means of a small screwdriver, and press the small button for at least 10 seconds, until all the LEDs lights up. Please use this procedure only when the network primary controller is missing or otherwise inoperable.
