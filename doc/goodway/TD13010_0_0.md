## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The TD13010 supports 5 association groups.

### Group 1: Group 1

Lifeline
Reports the device status and allows for assigning single device only (main controller by default).

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Group 2

alarm EP 1It is assigned to switch connected to the S1 terminal (uses Notification command class)

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Group 3

Switch 1It is assigned to switch connected to the S1 terminal (uses Basic command class)

Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 4: Group 4

alarm EP 2It is assigned to switch connected to the S1 terminal (uses Notification command class)

Association group 4 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 5: Group 5

Switch 2It is assigned to switch connected to the S1 terminal (uses Basic command class)
