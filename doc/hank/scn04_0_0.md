# SCN04 Four-key Scene Controller
This describes the Z-Wave device *SCN04*, manufactured by *Hank* with the thing type UID of ```hank_scn04_00_000```.

# Overview
Hank Z-Wave Scene Controller with 4 buttons. Supports security functions.

The Scene controller offers three button action types: short press, held down and release.  
  
\- If a button is pressed quickly (for less than a second), the scene controller sends a central scene notification command to association group 1. This message contains a scene number from 1-4 depending on which button is pressed. It also sends a basic set command to the items in the association group for the button (even groups numbered 2 to 8) and a multilevel set command to the nodes in the association group for the button with an uneven number (3 for button 1, 5 for button 2 etc.).  
\- If a button is pressed and held down for more than a second, the scene controller sends a central scene notification command to association group 1 as above. It also sends a multilevel start level change (i.e. dim up) command to the nodes in the association group for the button.  
\- If a button is released after it has been held down, the scene controller sends a similar central scene notification command as well as a multilevel stop command the buttons association group.
