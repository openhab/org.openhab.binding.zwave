The SCN04 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The SCN04 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

<p&gtHank Z-Wave Scene Controller with 4 buttons. Supports security functions.</p&gt <p&gtThe Scene controller offers three button action types: short press, held down and release.<br /&gt<br /&gt- If a button is pressed quickly (for less than a second), the scene controller sends a central scene notification command to association group 1. This message contains a scene number from 1-4 depending on which button is pressed. It also sends a basic set command to the items in the association group for the button (even groups numbered 2 to 8) and a multilevel set command to the nodes in the association group for the button with an uneven number (3 for button 1, 5 for button 2 etc.).<br /&gt- If a button is pressed and held down for more than a second, the scene controller sends a central scene notification command to association group 1 as above. It also sends a multilevel start level change (i.e. dim up) command to the nodes in the association group for the button.<br /&gt- If a button is released after it has been held down, the scene controller sends a similar central scene notification command as well as a multilevel stop command the buttons association group.</p&gt

Triple click the a button, if the exclusion is successful, LED will blink in orange for less than 5 seconds and then keep on for 3 seconds.</p&gt

### Wakeup Information

The SCN04 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


<p&gtPress and hold any button for three seconds.</p&gt

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the SCN04 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Scene Number | scene_number | scene_number |  | Number | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | system.battery_level | Battery | Number |

### Scene Number
Triggers when a scene button is pressed.

The ```scene_number``` channel is of type ```scene_number``` and supports the ```Number``` item.
This channel provides the scene, and the event as a decimal value in the form ```<scene>.<event>```. The scene number is set by the device, and the event is as follows -:

| Event ID | Event Description  |
|----------|--------------------|
| 0        | Single key press   |
| 1        | Key released       |
| 2        | Key held down      |
| 3        | Double keypress    |
| 4        | Tripple keypress   |
| 5        | 4 x keypress       |
| 6        | 5 x keypress       |

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.


## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 1 configuration parameters available in the SCN04.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 254 | Enable configuration | Lock/unlock all configuration parameters. |
|  | Wakeup Interval | Sets the interval at which the device will accept commands from the controller |
|  | Wakeup Node | Sets the node ID of the device to receive the wakeup notifications |

### Parameter 254: Enable configuration

Lock/unlock all configuration parameters.
<p&gtLock/unlock configuration of unit.</p&gt <p&gt0 = Unlock (default)<br /&gt1 = Lock</p&gt
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Unlock |
| 1 | Lock |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Unlock).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_254_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The SCN04 supports 9 association groups.

### Group 1: Central notification

Scene commands and battery reports
<p&gtScene Controller will send the central scene notification command and battery report command to the associated nodes if any button is triggered.</p&gt <p&gtButton 1-4 sends scene commands 1-4. I.e. button 1 sends scene 1, button 2 scene 2 etc. More info about all association group commands can be seen from the table below.</p&gt <table&gt<tr&gt<td&gt<strong&gtButton ID</strong&gt</td&gt <td&gt<strong&gtGroup ID</strong&gt</td&gt <td&gt<strong&gtAction & Notification</strong&gt</td&gt </tr&gt<tr&gt<td&gtAny button</td&gt <td&gt1</td&gt <td&gtPress: Central scene notification ( Key Attributes=0 )<br /&gtHold: Central scene notification ( Key Attributes=2 )<br /&gtRelease: Central scene notification ( Key attributes=1 )</td&gt </tr&gt<tr&gt<td&gtButton 1</td&gt <td&gt2</td&gt <td&gtPress: Basic Set<br /&gtHold: Reserve<br /&gtRelease: Reserve</td&gt </tr&gt<tr&gt<td&gt3</td&gt <td&gtPress: Switch multilevel set<br /&gtHold: Multilevel start level change<br /&gtRelease: Multilevel stop level change</td&gt </tr&gt<tr&gt<td&gtButton 2</td&gt <td&gt4</td&gt <td&gtPress: Basic Set<br /&gtHold: Reserve<br /&gtRelease: Reserve</td&gt </tr&gt<tr&gt<td&gt5</td&gt <td&gtPress: Switch multilevel set<br /&gtHold: Multilevel start level change<br /&gtRelease: Multilevel stop level change</td&gt </tr&gt<tr&gt<td&gtButton 3</td&gt <td&gt6</td&gt <td&gtPress: Basic Set<br /&gtHold: Reserve<br /&gtRelease: Reserve</td&gt </tr&gt<tr&gt<td&gt7</td&gt <td&gtPress: Switch multilevel set<br /&gtHold: Multilevel start level change<br /&gtRelease: Multilevel stop level change</td&gt </tr&gt<tr&gt<td&gtButton 4</td&gt <td&gt8</td&gt <td&gtPress: Basic Set<br /&gtHold: Reserve<br /&gtRelease: Reserve</td&gt </tr&gt<tr&gt<td&gt9</td&gt <td&gtPress: Switch multilevel set<br /&gtHold: Multilevel start level change<br /&gtRelease: Multilevel stop level change</td&gt </tr&gt</table&gt
