The 1402756 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

This is a switch multilevel device based on Z-wave enhanced 232 slave library of V6.81.03, and it can be easy configuration, operate and can make traditional LED dimmable lighting to be intelligent control.

### Inclusion Information

  1. Set primary controller/gateway into inclusion mode (Please refer top your primary controllers manual on how to set your controller into inclusion).
  2. Power on the in-wall dimmer.
  3. Tripple Press the reset button on the dimmer, it will set the dimmer into inclusion mode.  
    The purple indicator light will stay solid on for 10 seconds to indicate successful incusion.

### Exclusion Information

There are two exclusion methods:

  * Method 1: 
      1. Set the primary controller/gateway int exclusion mode (Please refer top your primary controllers manual on how to set your controller into exclusion).
      2. Triple press the reset button, the dimmer will be set to exclusion mode, and wait to be excluded, then the dimmer will be excluded form the network.
  * Method 2: Factory reset the dimmer will force the it to be excluded form a network. (Please refer to the part "Factory Reset" of the manual

Note: Factory reset is not recommended for exclusion, please use this procedure only if the primary controller/gateway is missing or otherwise inoperable.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The 1402756 supports 4 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
The ASSIC of Lifeline:4C 69 66 65 6C 69 6E 65

  1. when press and hold down "Reset" button over 5s to reset the dimmer send "Device Reset Locally Notification CC" to associated devices of this group to report factory reset information.
  2. When load state chages send "Switch Multilevel Report CC" to associated devices of this group.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Basic Set

Basic Set: 42 61 73 69 63 20 53 65 74

  1. Short press "Knob" turn on the dimmer Sends Basic Set(0XFF) to associeated devices.
  2. Short press "Knob" turn off the dimmer Sends Basic Set (0X00) to associated devices.

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Switch Multilevel

Switch Multilevel: 53 77 69 74 63 68 20 4D 75 6C 74 69 6C 65 76 65 6C

  1. "Turn knob to the left" sends Switch Multilevel Set(to keep associated devices in sync with this device) to associated devices.
  2. "Turn knob to the right" Sends Switch Multilevel Set(to keep associated devices in sync with this device) to associated devices.

Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 4: External Button

External Button: 45 78 74 65 72 6E 61 6C 20 42 75 74 74 6F 6E

  1. External Button hold send Switch Multilevel Start Level Change(Switchover dimmer Up/Down)
  2. External Button release send Switch Multilevel Stop Level Change.

Association group 4 supports 5 nodes.
