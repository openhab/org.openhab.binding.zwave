## Overview

Z-Wave relay for flush mounting. This relay is used to switch on/off connected lighting devices, and works with both halogen and LED light sources. Can be included and operated in a Z-Wave network with other Z-Wave devices, and will act as a signal repeater to increase the reliability of the network. With an indoor range of 40 metres, you can use this relay to switch the lighting on and off from almost anywhere in the house.

### Inclusion Information

  1. Set primary controller/gateway into inclusion mode (Please refer to your primary controllers manual on how to turn your controller into inclusion). 
  2. Power on the in-wall switch and set it into inclusion mode. There are two methods to set the in-wall switch into inclusion mode: 
      1.   Repower on the switch, it will be set into inclusion mode automatically, and waiting to be included.   
        
      2.   Triple press the action button on the switch, it will set the switch into inclusion mode.

### Exclusion Information

There are two exclusion methods: 

Method 1: Exclusion from the primary controller/gateway as follows: 

  1. Set the primary controller/gateway into exclusion mode (Please refer to your primary controllers manual on how to set your controller into exclusion). 
  2. Triple press the action button, the switch will be set to exclusion mode, and waiting to be excluded, then the switch will be excluded from the network. 

Method 2: Factory reset the switch will force the switch to be excluded from a network. (please refer to the part “Factory Reset” of this manual)

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The 4512715 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Lifeline association group
1. When press and hold down “Reset” button to factory reset the dimmer, send "Device Reset Locally Notification CC" to associated devices of this group. 

2. When load state changes, send "Basic Report CC" to associated devices of this group. 

3. When over temperature protection is detected, send "Emergency shutoff status" to Lifeline.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.
