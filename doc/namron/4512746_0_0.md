### Inclusion Information

  1. Set primary controller/gateway into inclusion mode (Please refer to your primary controllers manual on how to turn your controller into inclusion).
  2. Power on the in-wall switch and set it into inclusion mode. There are two methods to set the in-wall switch into inclusion mode:
      1. Triple press the action button on the switch, LED indicator will flash rapidly, it will set the switch into inclusion mode for 30 seconds, if there is no reply from the gateway, the device will quit inclusion mode after 30 seconds.
      2. When the value of parameter 5 is configured as 1, triple press the external switch rapidly within 1.5 seconds, LED indicator will flash rapidly, it will set the switch into inclusion mode for 30 seconds, if there is no reply from the gateway, the device will quit inclusion mode after 30 seconds.

The LED indicator will stay solid on for 3 seconds if the device is added to the network successfully. The indicator will turn off if inclusion fails.

### Exclusion Information

There are two exclusion methods:

Method 1: Exclusion from the primary controller/gateway as follows:

  1. Set the primary controller/gateway into exclusion mode (Please refer to your primary controllers manual on how to set your controller into exclusion).
  2. Power on the in-wall switch and set it into exclusion mode. There are two methods to set the in-wall switch into exclusion mode:
      1. Triple press the action button on the switch, LED indicator will flash rapidly, it will set the switch into exclusion mode for 30 seconds, if there is no reply from the gateway, the device will quit exclusion mode after 30 seconds.
      2. When the value of parameter 5 is configured as 1, triple press the external switch rapidly within 1.5 seconds, LED indicator will flash rapidly, it will set the switch into exclusion mode for 30 seconds, if there is no reply from the gateway, the device will quit exclusion mode after 30 seconds.

| Electric meter (watts) | meter_watts | meter_watts | Energy | Number | 
| Electric meter (volts) | meter_voltage | meter_voltage | Energy | Number | 
| Electric meter (amps) | meter_current | meter_current | Energy | Number | 
| Alarm (power) | alarm_power | alarm_power | Energy | Switch | 

### Switch
Switch the power on and off.

The ```switch_binary``` channel is of type ```switch_binary``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Switch``` category.

### Scene Number
Triggers when a scene button is pressed.

The ```scene_number``` channel is of type ```scene_number``` and supports the ```Number``` item.

### Electric meter (kWh)
Indicates the energy consumption (kWh).

The ```meter_kwh``` channel is of type ```meter_kwh``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Electric meter (watts)
Indicates the instantaneous power consumption.

The ```meter_watts``` channel is of type ```meter_watts``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Electric meter (volts)
Indicates the instantaneous voltage.

The ```meter_voltage``` channel is of type ```meter_voltage``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Electric meter (amps)
Indicates the instantaneous current consumption.

The ```meter_current``` channel is of type ```meter_current``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Alarm (power)
Indicates if a power alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_power``` channel is of type ```alarm_power``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |



## Device Configuration

The device has no configuration parameters defined.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The  4512746 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
1. When press and hold down “Reset” button for 10S to reset the device, send "Device Reset Locally Notification" to associated devices of this group to report factory reset information.

2. When over load detected, send "NOTIFICATION_REPORT" to associated devices of this group.

3. Report energy meter actively.

4. Send basic report automatically

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.
