## Overview

Z-wave in-wall dimmer v2 with power consumption monitoring. 400W 1 channel.

### Inclusion Information

  1. Set primary controller/gateway into inclusion mode (Please refer to your primary controller’s manual on how to turn your controller into inclusion).
  2.  Power on the in-wall dimmer and set it into inclusion mode. There are two methods to set the in-wall dimmer into inclusion mode:
      1. Repower on the dimmer, it will be set into inclusion mode automatically, and waiting to be included.
      2. Triple press the action button on the dimmer, it will set the dimmer into inclusion mode.

The connected light will stay solid on for 3 seconds to indicate successful inclusion.

### Exclusion Information

There are two exclusion methods:

Method 1: Exclusion from the primary controller/gateway as follows:

  1. Set the primary controller/gateway into exclusion mode (Please refer to your primary controllers manual on how to set your controller into exclusion).
  2. Triple press the action button, the dimmer will be set to exclusion mode, and waiting to be excluded, then the dimmer will be excluded from the network.

Method 2: Factory reset the dimmer will force it to be excluded from a network. (please refer to the part “Factory Reset” of this manual)

Note: Factory reset is not recommended for exclusion, please use this procedure only if the primary controller/gateway is missing or otherwise inoperable.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The 4512724 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
1. When press and hold down “Reset” button for 10S to reset the dimmer, send "Device Reset Locally Notification CC" to associated devices of this group to report factory reset information.

2. When load state changes, send "Basic Report CC" to associated devices of this group.

3. When a load over current is detected, send "Over-current detected" to Lifeline.

4. When a mains voltage drop is detected, send "Voltage drop/drift" to Lifeline.

5. When over temperature is detected, send “Emergency shutoff status" to Lifeline.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.
