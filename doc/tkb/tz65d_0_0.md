# TZ65D Dual Paddle Wall Dimmer
This describes the Z-Wave device *TZ65D*, manufactured by *TKB Home* with the thing type UID of ```tkb_tz65d_00_000```.

The device is in the category of *Wall Switch*, defining Any device attached to the wall that controls a binary status of something, for ex. a light switch.

The TZ65D supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

The TZ65D wall mounted 3-way dimmer switch is a component of the lighting control system.This wall mounted dimmer switch is designed to work with other Z-Wave enabled devices. Z-Wave nodes of other types can be added to the system and will also act as repeaters if they support this function of repeating the signal received to other modules in the system.As part of a Z-Wave network, the TZ65D will also act as a wireless repeater to insure that commands intended for another device in the network are received. This is useful when the device would otherwise be out of the radio range of the wireless controller.   

### Inclusion Information

Including to the network (must be installed in its permanent location, not on test bench)

  1. Setup the controller you are using to include a device into network.
  2. Tap either the top or bottom of the switch once.

### Exclusion Information

  1. Setup the controller you are using to exclude a device from the network.
  2. Tap either the top or the bottom of the switch once.

### General Usage Information

BASIC OPERATION (Local control)  
The left switch on the TZ65D allows the user to:

  * Turn ON or OFF the attached load.
  * Include or exclude the module from the Z-Wave system.
  * Control other Z-Wave enabled devices.(one “associated” group of 5 each-Groups 1)

The right switch on the TZ65D allows the user to:

  * Control other Z-WAVE enable devices (two “associated” group of 5 each-Groups 1)

Also, when a controller prompts you to “Send Node ID” or to “Press Button on Unit”, quickly tap the switch ON or OFF once to satisfy those instructions.

  * Tapping top of left switch turns the load attached ON.
  * Tapping bottom of left switch turns the load attached OFF
  * Pressing and holding the left switch will allow dimming and brightening the attached load or the other Z-Wave dimmers if associated. Same for the right switch.

Caution: When dimmed are at the lowest setting, even though the load looks like its off, it still has power. Tap bottom of switch to turn off completely. It is best to turn off the power at the circuit breaker to service the load.  
Upon restoration of power after a power loss, the TZ65D returns to previous known state. LED IndicationThe LED on the TZ65D will turn on when the load attached is off, to act as a night light. However, the LED can be user configured to turn on when the load attached is on. The TZ65D will flicker its LED when it is transmitting to any of the 4 groups. This can be changed if desired. See “LED transmission indication”.  

ADVANCED OPERATION

  * The TZ65D supports the ALL ON/ALL OFF commands. 

## Channels

### Dimmer
The brightness channel allows to control the brightness of a light.
            It is also possible to switch the light on and off.

The ```switch_dimmer``` channel is of type ```switch_dimmer``` and supports the ```Dimmer``` item and is in the ```DimmableLight``` category.
