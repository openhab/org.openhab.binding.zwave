The TZ67 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

The TKB TZ67 is a dimmer plug that can be placed between a British Standard wall outlet for Plug Type G and electric devices, plugged in by cord. It can dim resistive loads up to 3500 W. The device is IP 20 rated and can therefore only be used in dry environments. For dimming the devices apply leading edge phase cutting. It is therefore only possible to dim incandescent lamps and high voltage halogen lights. Low voltage halogen lights, LEDs and CFLs must not be attached. Dimming is controlled wirelessly using Z-Wave or locally applying a button. A red LED indicates the dimming status.
