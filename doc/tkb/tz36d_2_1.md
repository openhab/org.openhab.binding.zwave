The TZ36D supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

The TKB Z-Wave dual wall switch is switching attached loads and is controlled either by the local switching paddle or remotely via the Z-Wave wireless protocol  
It is included and controlled in a Z-Wave network by a remote control, a wireless control centre or any other kind of Z-Wave controller including a PC-software.

### Inclusion Information

| 0 | Normal behaviour. |
| 1 | Switch top and buttom button. |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Normal behaviour.).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 4: LED transmission indication

LED transmission indication
Tranmission indication behaviour control.

This parameter controls the LED behaviour when transmitting data to any of the group members.
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Do not flicker. |
| 1 | Flicker for 1 second at the beginning |

| 2 | Include in All Off group |
| 255 | Include in All On and All Off groups |

This parameter has the configuration ID ```switchall_mode``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The TZ36D supports 4 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: On/Off Dimmer 1

Use the Left Switch to control a group

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: On/Off Dimmer 2


Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 4: wireless


Association group 4 supports 5 nodes.
