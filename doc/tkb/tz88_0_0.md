The TZ88 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

This plug-in ON/OFF switch TZ88 is a security enabled wireless switch, based on Z-Wave Plus technology. Z-Wave Plus™ enabled devices displaying the Z-Wave Plus™ logo can also be used with it regardless of the manufacturer, and can also be used in other manufacturer’s Z-Wave™ enabled network

### Inclusion Information

Pressing On/Off button three times within 2 seconds will enter inclusion mode. 

### Exclusion Information

Pressing On/Off button three times within 2 seconds will enter exclusion mode.

### Electric meter (kWh)
Indicates the energy consumption (kWh).

The ```meter_kwh``` channel is of type ```meter_kwh``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Electric meter (volts)
Indicates the instantaneous voltage.

The ```meter_voltage``` channel is of type ```meter_voltage``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.



## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 4 configuration parameters available in the TZ88.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Watt meter report interval (5s) | Interval (x5 seconds) to send out watt meter report |
| 2 | KWH Meter Report Interval (10min) | Interval (x10 minutes) to send out KWH Meter Report |
| 3 | Threshold for Load Caution (10mA) | Threshold (x0.01A) of current for Load Caution |
| 4 | Threshold of KWh for Load Caution |  |
|  | Switch All Mode | Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands |

### Parameter 1: Watt meter report interval (5s)

Interval (x5 seconds) to send out watt meter report

Values in the range 1 to 32767 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```720```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: KWH Meter Report Interval (10min)

Interval (x10 minutes) to send out KWH Meter Report

Values in the range 1 to 32767 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```6```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: Threshold for Load Caution (10mA)

Threshold (x0.01A) of current for Load Caution

Values in the range 1 to 1300 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1300```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 4: Threshold of KWh for Load Caution



Values in the range 1 to 10000 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```10000```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_4_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Switch All Mode

Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands.

The following option values may be configured -:
| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Exclude from All On and All Off groups |
| 1 | Include in All On group |
| 2 | Include in All Off group |
| 255 | Include in All On and All Off groups |

This parameter has the configuration ID ```switchall_mode``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The TZ88 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Target for automatic reports


Association group 1 supports 1 node.
