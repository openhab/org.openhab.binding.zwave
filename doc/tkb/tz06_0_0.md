The TZ06 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

This in-wall switch module is a transceiver which is a Z-Wave Plus™ enabled device and is fully compatible with any Z-Wave enabled network.

Mini size design let the module can easily hide itself into the wall box and that will be good for the house decoration.

There are many kind of application by using the module to switch Load On and Off, one main application is the light control.

### Inclusion Information

In the front casing, there is an on/off button with LED indicator below which is to toggle switch on and off or carries out inclusion, exclusion, reset or association.  When first power is applied, its LED flashes on and off alternately and repeatedly at 0.5 second intervals.  It implies that it has not been assigned a node ID and start auto inclusion.

Pressing the Include button of TZ06 three times within 2 seconds will enter inclusion mode

### Exclusion Information

Pressing the Include button of TZ06 three times within 2 seconds will enter exclusion mode

| 4 | Auto OFF Timer | Auto OFF Timer Countdown |
| 5 | RF Command Mode | RF Command Mode |
| 6 | Existence of Endpoint 3 | Existence of Endpoint 3 |
|  | Switch All Mode | Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands |

### Parameter 1: Selected Relay

Selected Relay (Endpoint)
If Controller not using Multi_Channel command class to access the endpoint of PAN06, you may configure the endpoint value to react the Basic Command Class

Relay 1: Only Relay 1 can be controlled and configured  
Relay 2: Only Relay 2 can be controlled and configured  
Relay 1 & 2: Both Relays can be controlled and configured
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Relay 1 |
| 2 | Relay 2 |
| 3 | Relay 1&2 |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```3``` (Relay 1&2).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: External Switch Mode

Change the External Switch (S1 & S2) Mode
Manual Switch S1 and S2 can be set to Edge mode or Pulse mode or Edge-Toggle mode, default value is Edge mode.
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Edge mode |
| 2 | Pulse mode |
| 3 | Edge-Toggle mode |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (Edge mode).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: Restore Switch State

Restore Switch State after AC power loss
Whenever the AC Power return from lost, TZ06 will restore the Switch state which could be SWITCH OFF, LAST SWITCH STATE, SWITCH ON.  The default setting is LAST SWITCH STATE.
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The TZ06 supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Relay 1 + 2


Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Relay 1
