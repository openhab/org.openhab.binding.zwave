# MT02650 Devolo Thermostat (09356)
This describes the Z-Wave device *MT02650*, manufactured by *Danfoss* with the thing type UID of ```danfoss_mt02650_00_000```.

The device is in the category of *Radiator Control*, defining Controls on radiators used to heat up rooms.

The MT02650 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The MT02650 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

### Wakeup Information

The MT02650 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the MT02650 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Sensor (temperature) | sensor_temperature | sensor_temperature | Temperature | Number:Temperature | 
| Setpoint (heating) | thermostat_setpoint | thermostat_setpoint | Heating | Number:Temperature | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | system.battery_level | Battery | Number |
| Clock Time Offset | time_offset | time_offset | Time | Number | 

### Sensor (temperature)
Indicates the current temperature.

The ```sensor_temperature``` channel is of type ```sensor_temperature``` and supports the ```Number:Temperature``` item and is in the ```Temperature``` category.

### Setpoint (heating)
Sets the thermostat setpoint.

The ```thermostat_setpoint``` channel is of type ```thermostat_setpoint``` and supports the ```Number:Temperature``` item and is in the ```Heating``` category.

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.
### Clock Time Offset
Provides the current time difference for the devices time.

The ```time_offset``` channel is of type ```time_offset``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Time``` category.



## Device Configuration

The device has no configuration parameters defined.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The MT02650 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Target for Wakeup and Override Notifications

A group of devices that receive temperature reports and an alarm in the event of a sensor shutdown. This group can have up to 10 devices with a controller in mind, which is recommended to be included in this group.

Association group 1 supports 10 nodes.

### Group 2: Temprature sensor

A group of connections for connecting a room temperature sensor, in which it will be necessary to add a Z-Wave temperature sensor, the temperature of which the thermostat will use to control the heating device. Only one temperature sensor can be added to this group.

Association group 2 supports 1 node.
