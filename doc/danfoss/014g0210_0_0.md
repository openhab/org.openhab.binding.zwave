## Overview

<p&gtProduct information "Danfoss HC10 (Hydronic contoller for 10 outputs)"</p&gt <p&gtThe Danfoss HC (Hydronic Controller) is part of the wireless Z-wave controlsystems for heating systems in residential homes.</p&gt <p&gtThe Danfoss HC allows the control of warmwater floor heating systems. The system offers a big bandwidth of advanced functions for optimal comfort and energy savings and allows a single room temperature control.</p&gt <p&gtThe Danfoss HC includes among other things: 10 short circiut safe outputs for 24V actuator drives NC or NO, Relays for pump and boilercontrol, self-testing program, regulation by ON/OFF- or PWM-principle (pulse width modulation) etc.</p&gt <p&gtThe system can exist of multiple Danfoss HC for bigger systems with more than 10 actuators drives. The Danfoss HC has a direct connector to a power supply of 230V. Because of that you do not need an additional transformer but all actuator drives will be supplied with 24V power.</p&gt <p&gtÂ <strong&gtFeatures:</strong&gt</p&gt <ul&gt<li&gtControlling of warmwater floor heating systems</li&gt <li&gt10 short circuit protected outputs with LED notice</li&gt <li&gtOutput for 24V actuator drive NC or NO</li&gt <li&gtGuarantee of valve function at alle outputs even when there is temperatur control, every 14 day valve movement for ca. 12 minutes</li&gt <li&gtRegulation by PWM-principle (pulse width modulation)</li&gt <li&gtRelays for pump regulation with automatic 1 minute pump start-up on every third day, to avoid damages during the Standby time periods</li&gt <li&gtRelays for boiler regulation, only active during warming needs</li&gt <li&gtAutomatic self diagnostics to show lost connection to the device</li&gt <li&gtWireless technologie: Z-Wave</li&gt </ul&gt

| 3 | PWM period | Pulse-width modulation period |

### Parameter 1: Valve Type

Type of Valve being controlled
<p&gtParameter 1: Valve type:</p&gt <ul&gt<li&gt0 = Normal Closed (NC) default</li&gt <li&gt1 = Normal Open (NO)</li&gt </ul&gt<p&gtMix of NC and NO types of valves is not supported</p&gt <p&gtMost systems use NC valves</p&gt
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | NC |
| 1 | NO |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (NC).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Heat Load Strategy

Set Head Load Strategy (0 = Stacking, 1 = Spreading)
<p&gtHeat load strategy:</p&gt <ul&gt<li&gt0 = Stacking (default)</li&gt <li&gt1 = Spreading</li&gt </ul&gt<p&gt<strong&gtStacking</strong&gt:</p&gt <ul&gt<li&gtAll endpoints where there are heat demand open at the same time at the start of each PWM period</li&gt <li&gtStacking is the default strategy</li&gt </ul&gt<p&gt<strong&gtSpreading</strong&gt:</p&gt <ul&gt<li&gtThe opening of valves is spread over the PWM period and may stretch into the next PWM period</li&gt <li&gtSpreading is used in effort to: <ul&gt<li&gtSpread the demand for hot water over the PWM period</li&gt <li&gtSpread the power demand for the valves (actuators) <ul&gt<li&gtValves from different producers require different amount of energy. The power supply in the HC has limited capacity, and may not be able to feed all the valves at the same time (more about that later in âCurrent limitationâ)</li&gt </ul&gt</li&gt </ul&gt</li&gt </ul&gt
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |

Pulse-width modulation period
<p&gtThe PWM period can be set to 15, 30 or 60 seconds</p&gt <p&gtSet using the Configuration Command Class on each endpoint</p&gt <ul&gt<li&gt60 minutes PWM period <ul&gt<li&gtIs the default value</li&gt <li&gtIntended for heavy floors <ul&gt<li&gtThick concrete floors</li&gt <li&gtFloors where the hot water pipes lie deep</li&gt </ul&gt</li&gt </ul&gt</li&gt <li&gt15 minutes PWM period <ul&gt<li&gtIntended for light floors <ul&gt<li&gtWood floors</li&gt <li&gtFloors where the hot water pipes lie close to the surface</li&gt </ul&gt</li&gt </ul&gt</li&gt </ul&gt<p&gtBased on the setpoint (target temperature) and the current room temperature, the HC control algorithm calculates how long portion of each PWM period the valve should be open to get to and maintain the target temperature</p&gt
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | 15 minutes |
| 1 | 30 minutes |
| 2 | 60 minutes |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```2``` (60 minutes).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The 014G0210 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
<p&gtOne group supported: 1 with profile "General-Life-line"</p&gt <ul&gt<li&gtLifeline for endpoints</li&gt <li&gtUnsolicited reports: <ul&gt<li&gtDevice Reset Locally Notification</li&gt <li&gtNotification Report (Thermostat 1 only)</li&gt </ul&gt</li&gt </ul&gt

Association group 1 supports 1 node.
