## Overview

Product information "Danfoss HC10 (Hydronic contoller for 10 outputs)"

The Danfoss HC (Hydronic Controller) is part of the wireless Z-wave controlsystems for heating systems in residential homes.

The Danfoss HC allows the control of warmwater floor heating systems. The system offers a big bandwidth of advanced functions for optimal comfort and energy savings and allows a single room temperature control.

The Danfoss HC includes among other things: 10 short circiut safe outputs for 24V actuator drives NC or NO, Relays for pump and boilercontrol, self-testing program, regulation by ON/OFF- or PWM-principle (pulse width modulation) etc.

The system can exist of multiple Danfoss HC for bigger systems with more than 10 actuators drives. The Danfoss HC has a direct connector to a power supply of 230V. Because of that you do not need an additional transformer but all actuator drives will be supplied with 24V power.

Â **Features:**

  * Controlling of warmwater floor heating systems
  * 10 short circuit protected outputs with LED notice
  * Output for 24V actuator drive NC or NO
  * Guarantee of valve function at alle outputs even when there is temperatur control, every 14 day valve movement for ca. 12 minutes
  * Regulation by PWM-principle (pulse width modulation)
  * Relays for pump regulation with automatic 1 minute pump start-up on every third day, to avoid damages during the Standby time periods
  * Relays for boiler regulation, only active during warming needs
  * Automatic self diagnostics to show lost connection to the device
  * Wireless technologie: Z-Wave

### Inclusion Information

## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 3 configuration parameters available in the 014G0210.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Valve Type | Type of Valve being controlled |
| 2 | Heat Load Strategy | Set Head Load Strategy (0 = Stacking, 1 = Spreading) |
| 3 | PWM period | Pulse-width modulation period |

### Parameter 1: Valve Type

Type of Valve being controlled
Parameter 1: Valve type:

  * 0 = Normal Closed (NC) default
  * 1 = Normal Open (NO)

Mix of NC and NO types of valves is not supported

Most systems use NC valves
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | NC |
| 1 | NO |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (NC).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Heat Load Strategy

Set Head Load Strategy (0 = Stacking, 1 = Spreading)
Heat load strategy:

  * 0 = Stacking (default)
  * 1 = Spreading

**Stacking**:

  * All endpoints where there are heat demand open at the same time at the start of each PWM period
  * Stacking is the default strategy

**Spreading**:

  * The opening of valves is spread over the PWM period and may stretch into the next PWM period
  * Spreading is used in effort to: 
      * Spread the demand for hot water over the PWM period
      * Spread the power demand for the valves (actuators) 
          * Valves from different producers require different amount of energy. The power supply in the HC has limited capacity, and may not be able to feed all the valves at the same time (more about that later in âCurrent limitationâ)
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Stacking (Default) |
| 1 | Spreading |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Stacking (Default)).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: PWM period

Pulse-width modulation period
The PWM period can be set to 15, 30 or 60 seconds

Set using the Configuration Command Class on each endpoint

  * 60 minutes PWM period 
      * Is the default value
      * Intended for heavy floors 
          * Thick concrete floors
          * Floors where the hot water pipes lie deep
  * 15 minutes PWM period 
      * Intended for light floors 
          * Wood floors
          * Floors where the hot water pipes lie close to the surface

Based on the setpoint (target temperature) and the current room temperature, the HC control algorithm calculates how long portion of each PWM period the valve should be open to get to and maintain the target temperature
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | 15 minutes |
| 1 | 30 minutes |
| 2 | 60 minutes |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```2``` (60 minutes).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The 014G0210 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
One group supported: 1 with profile "General-Life-line"

  * Lifeline for endpoints
  * Unsolicited reports: 
      * Device Reset Locally Notification
      * Notification Report (Thermostat 1 only)

Association group 1 supports 1 node.
