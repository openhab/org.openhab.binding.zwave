The DSB28 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

Aeon Labs Home Energy Meter is a kind of energy meter for the entire home electric power consumption. It can report immediate wattage and kWh and voltage and amperage usage of the AC mains to a Z-Wave gateway wirelessly.

It can send Z-Wave REPORTS (Meter v3 Command Class) to response Z-Wave GET command at any time.

HEM can also be configured as sending unsolicited reports periodically to the associated nodes (within an association group). The time interval of reports can also be configured HEM can also send report of each individual channel with corresponding current clamp via the command of “Multi Channel Command Class Encapsulation ”.

To reduce the network traffic, HEM can send reports only when the loads significant change occurred(by percentage or Wattage value change, which can be configured)
