The DSA03202 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

The Minimote is a fully functional Z-Wave remote control capable of adding, removing and controlling other Z-Wave devices. It can also become a secondary or inclusion controller to a SIS gateway in the Z-Wave network. Form-factor, industrial design and robust functionality are the major foci. RF range is 100ft. indoors and 300ft. outdoors.

Network setup buttons (such as adding and removing Z-Wave products to the network) are located underneath the bottom-slide door while Z-Wave scene control buttons are easily available to the user on the top of the remote controller.

By taking advantage of the Z-Wave mesh network, commands can be routed to their destination via intermediary “listening” Z-Wave products. Products that are Z-Wave certified can be used and communicate with other Z-Wave certified devices. 

### Inclusion Information

1. Press the button labeled “Learn” – The blue LED will blink slowly.

2. Press the button labeled “Include” on the other Z-Wave controller - The blue and red LEDs will blink quickly to indicate detection of the other Z-Wave controller.

Consult the operation manual of other controllers for instructions on how to add the Minimote as a secondary/inclusion controller into an existing network.

3. Consult the operation manual of other controllers for instructions on how to add the Minimote as a secondary/inclusion controller into an existing network.

### Exclusion Information

Once added as a secondary controller, the Minimote cannot be excluded. To remove it from the network, it must be reset.

1. Press and hold both the buttons labeled “Associate” and “Learn” for 10 seconds – The red LED will blink from slow to fast.

2. The blue LEDs will stay solid for 2 seconds to indicate success.

### Wakeup Information

The DSA03202 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


1. Press and hold the button labeled “Learn” for 3 seconds – The Minimote will stay awake for 30 seconds.

2. The blue LEDs will stay solid for 2 seconds to indicate success.

### General Usage Information

When configuration parameter 250 is enabled, the scene_number channel will have the following values, based on which button is used:

This is a write only parameter.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The DSA03202 supports 4 association groups.

### Group 1: Scene 1


Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Scene 2


Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Scene 3


Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 4: Scene 4


Association group 4 supports 5 nodes.
