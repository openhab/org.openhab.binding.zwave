The DSB45 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The DSB45 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

The Aeotec Z-Wave Water Sensor is able to detect the accidental presence of water, from small leaks to large floods, making it the perfect emergency accessory for your smart home network. This smart water sensor will send radio signals up to 6 associated Z-Wave devices within your Z-Wave smart home network when the water probe detects water. The Aeotec Z-Wave Water Sensor is capable of detecting both the absence and presence of water at measurements as small as 0.03% of an inch.

### Inclusion Information

  1. On the rear of your water sensor, remove the spacing tab to connect the batteries. Your water sensor's LED will blink for 8 seconds.
  2. Place your controller into Inclusion Mode.
  3. Press the Z-Wave button on your water sensor. If it has been successfully added to your Z-Wve network, its LED will illuminate for 10 minutes, During this period your primary Z-Wave controller is able to configure your sensor

### Exclusion Information

  1. Press the Z-Wave button on your sensor.
  2. If your sensor has been successfully removed from your network, its LED will blink for 8 seconds. If the removal was unsuccessful the LED will be switched on for 8 seconds

### Wakeup Information

The DSB45 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


To wake up the sensor, _don't_ push the wake up button, as it does nothing.  Instead, tap the zwave button once.  Use wake up button to put back to sleep immediately.

Press WakeUp button or hold z-wave button

The Water Sensor will keep waking up for 8 seconds after sending the wake up notification command.  
The Water Sensor will keep waking up for 8 seconds to waiting for the next command after receiving a command.  
The Water Sensor will be woken up for 10 minutes when power is on (configurable).  
There are 3 ways to exit the Wake up 10 minutes state:

  1. Triple click the tamper switch, and the Water Sensor will sleep immediately
  2. Receive the “Wake up no more information CC” command , sleep right now;
  3. Receive the other command except “Wake up no more information CC” , the Water Sensor will wake up for 8 seconds and then go to sleep.

### General Usage Information

Sensor Reset:

  1. Press and hold the Z-Wave button on the rear of your water sensor for 20 seconds.
  2. Your water sensor will reset to its factory default configuration. Its LED will be on for 2 seconds to let you know the reset was successful.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the DSB45 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Binary Sensor | sensor_binary | sensor_binary |  | Switch | 
| Flood Alarm | alarm_flood | alarm_flood | Water | Switch | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | system.battery_level | Battery | Number |

### Binary Sensor
Indicates if a sensor has triggered.

The ```sensor_binary``` channel is of type ```sensor_binary``` and supports the ```Switch``` item. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| ON | Triggered |
| OFF | Untriggered |

### Flood Alarm
Indicates if the flood alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_flood``` channel is of type ```alarm_flood``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Water``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (Send Basic Set).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_121_4_0000FF00``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The DSB45 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Group 1


Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.
