The DSA22 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

Remote controls revolutionized the way we could do things. They changed the way we watch TV. They changed we listen to music. They even changed the way we park our cars. And then they stopped revolutionizing and instead evolved to become more and more complex. They became bigger. They became weighed down with too many buttons, too many confusing things that you _could_ do.

The Aeotec Key Fob Remote Control takes the remote back to where it began. It’s easy to use. It’s simple. It’s small. It’s there for when you need it and it’s out of sight for when you don’t. It’s been designed to further the Z-Wave revolution.

### Inclusion Information

  1. Using something such as a pin or a paper clip, press the Learn button on the Key Fob Remote Control. Its light will begin to pulse.
  2. Press the Include button on your primary Z-Wave controller. If you’re unsure of how to do this, refer to its user manual.
  3. Once the two devices have exchanged information, the light on the Key Fob Remote Control will stay lit for 2 seconds.

### Exclusion Information

Resetting your Key Fob Remote Control

If you ever want to completely reset your Key Fob Remote Control’s settings, you can.

  1. Using a pin or a paper clip, press and hold the Mode button 10 seconds.
  2. The green and red light are blinking when Key Fob Remote Control is resetting, and the green light on your Key Fob Remote Control will stay lit for 2 seconds when successful. If learn unsuccess, the red light on the Portable Panic Button will stay lit for 2 seconds, then repeat from start step 1 again.

### Wakeup Information

The DSA22 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the DSA22 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Scene Number  [Deprecated]| scene_number | scene_number |  | Number | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | system.battery_level | Battery | Number |

### Scene Number [Deprecated]
Triggers when a scene button is pressed.

The ```scene_number``` channel is of type ```scene_number``` and supports the ```Number``` item.

**Note:** This channel is marked as deprecated so should not be used.

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.


## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 4 configuration parameters available in the DSA22.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 241 | Mode of Button 1 (upper left) | Defines the switching mode of Button 1 |
| 242 | Mode of Button 2 (upper right) | Defines the switching mode of Button 2 |
| 243 | Mode of Button 3 (lower left) | Defines the switching mode of Button 3 |
| 244 | Mode of Button 4 (lower right) | Defines the switching mode of Button 4 |
|  | Wakeup Interval | Sets the interval at which the device will accept commands from the controller |
|  | Wakeup Node | Sets the node ID of the device to receive the wakeup notifications |

### Parameter 241: Mode of Button 1 (upper left)

Defines the switching mode of Button 1

The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Factory Default |
| 1 | Scene Mode |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Factory Default).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_241_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 242: Mode of Button 2 (upper right)

Defines the switching mode of Button 2

The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Factory Default |
| 1 | Scene Mode |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Factory Default).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_242_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 243: Mode of Button 3 (lower left)

Defines the switching mode of Button 3

The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Factory Default |
| 1 | Scene Mode |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Factory Default).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_243_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 244: Mode of Button 4 (lower right)

Defines the switching mode of Button 4

The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Factory Default |
| 1 | Scene Mode |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Factory Default).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_244_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The DSA22 supports 4 association groups.

### Group 1: Scene 1


Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Scene 2


Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Scene 3


Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 4: Scene 4


Association group 4 supports 5 nodes.
