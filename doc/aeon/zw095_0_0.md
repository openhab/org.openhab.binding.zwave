The ZW095 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

Aeon Labs Home Energy Meter is energy meter for the entire home. It can wirelessly report instantaneous Power, KWH, Voltage and Amperage measurements to Z‐Wave gateway/controller. It can send Z‐Wave REPORTS (Meter v3 Command Class) at any time when it receives Z‐Wave Get Commands.

The HEM can be setup to send automatic reports to any associated nodes in association group 1 at an interval time

The HEM can independently report the measurements from the Clamps via the Multi Channel Command Class encapsulation.

It can be included and operated in any Z‐wave network with other Z‐wave certified devices from other manufacturers and/or other applications. All non‐battery operated nodes within the network will act as repeaters regardless of vendor to increase reliability of the network.

It also supports Security Command Class and has the AES‐128 bit security encryption built right in. While a Security enabled Controller is needed in order to fully use the security feature.

### Inclusion Information

The electrical installation of your Home Energy Meter (HEM) is now complete. You must now wirelessly add it to your Z-Wave network.

  1. Put your primary Z-Wave controller, usually a gateway or hub, into inclusion mode. If you are not sure how to do this, please refer to your controller’s user manual.
  2. Press the Action Button on your HEM. If it has been successfully added to your network, its LED will remain illuminated. If the adding was unsuccessful, your HEM’s LED will continue to blink.

The installation of your Home Energy Meter is now complete. The next step is to set up your Home Energy Meter within the interface of your primary Z-Wave controller. This will allow you to visualize and utilize the energy consumption data that your meter collects. Your Home Energy Meter can report wattage energy usage or KWH energy usage to your primary controller. As each controller is different, please refer to your controller’s user manual for further information on monitoring and visualizing this data. The Z-Wave commands supporting energy monitoring are the Meter Command Classes.

### Exclusion Information

Resetting your Home Energy Meter.

At some stage or your primary controller is missing or inoperable, you may also wish to reset all of your Home Energy Monitor’s settings to their factory defaults. To do this, press and hold the action button for 10 seconds and then release it. Your HEM will now be

Removing:

Removing your meter from a Z-Wave network. Your Home Energy Meter (HEM) can be removed from your Z-Wave network at any time. You'll need to use your Z-Wave network’s primary to do this

  1. Put your main controller into its device removal mode. If you are unsure how to do this, please refer to your controller’s user manual.
  2. Press the Action Button on your HEM. If it has been successfully removed from your network, its LED will blink. If the removal was unsuccessful, its LED will be solid and it will be then repeated again.

Which reports need to send in Report group 1
This page provides examples for setting the type of reports you want from the clamps and total readings using Parameter 101-103 for Home Energy Meter Gen5 and form part of the larger Home Energy Meter Gen5 user guide.

To set specific reports for your HEM Gen5, refer to the decimal table below if you do not know how to read a binary table. All you will need to do is add the decimal values together of all the settings you want, and then utilize the sum as the parameter setting value.

The table above shows a decimal representation of all flags that can be set on  parameter 101-103 to report specific data.

**Example use of the Report Table.**

For example, if you want to report only the total KWH consumption, and the  Wattage for clamp 3, you would add 1 + 1024 and set the sum (1025) to parameter 101, 102, or 103. 

As another example, if you want to report Wattage and KWH power consumption  for all clamps, you would add 256 + 512 + 1024 + 2048 + 4096 + 8192, then set the sum (16128) to parameter 101, 102, or 103. 

And if you want to report everything, you would add the whole table together and set it to 101, and set 102 and 103 to 0 values. 

**Setting an automatic report interval.**

Parameter 111-113 [4 byte dec] can be configured through your gateway in case  the default settings of your HEM is not what you desire. 

Parameter 111 will set the interval for Group 1 (parameter 101), parameter 112 will set the interval for Group 2 (parameter 102), and parameter 113 will set the interval for Group 3 (parameter 103). 

As an example, you have set parameter 101 to report the total KWH consumption  and the wattage for clamp 3, and you want to report it every 500 seconds. Set Parameter 111 [4 byte dec] to 500.

**Utilizing different groups.**

Your Home Energy Meter has 3 different groups that you may setup, from the  settings and examples above, you may configure each group to report different clamps and total reports to report at different interval. Group 1 uses Parameter 101 and 111, group 2 uses parameter 102 and 112, and group 3 uses parameter 103 and 113.
Values in the range 0 to 2147483647 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```120```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_113_4``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 252: Lock Configuration

Enable/Disable Lock Configuration
Enable/Disable Lock ConfigurationThis is an advanced parameter and will therefore not show in the user interface without entering advanced mode.
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|

| 1 | All conf parame are not configurable (Locked). |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (All configuration parameters are configurable.).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_252_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 255: Reset to Default Factory Setting

Reset all settings to factory defaults
Will reset the configuration to factory defaults.  If you upgrade firmware and are getting crazy readings back, reset the unit and reconfigure it.This is an advanced parameter and will therefore not show in the user interface without entering advanced mode.
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Do nothing |
| 1 | Reset to Factory Defaults |
| 1431655765 | Reset product to def factory setting and exclude |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Do nothing).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_255_4_wo``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.
This is a write only parameter.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZW095 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.
