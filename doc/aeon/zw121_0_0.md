The ZW121 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

Aeotec LED Strip has been crafted to power connected lighting using Z-Wave Plus. It is powered by Aeotec’s Gen5 technology. The LED Strip is a multi-colored LED Strip which allows control (on/off/dim/color change) via Z-Wave commands.

Note that configuration parameters 37 and 39 only apply when the strip is in color transition mode. Color transition mode is entered when a change to parameter 37 or 39 is submitted. Color transition mode is exited when a change to any of the channels is submitted. 

### Inclusion Information

  1. Set your Z-Wave controller into pairing mode.
  2. Press the Action Button located on the back of the LED Strip's white controller box once (The network LED will blink green as an indication it is pairing insecurely, please refer to section "Enabling Security Encryption" in the Advanced Function section of the manual to pair it securely).
  3. If the LED Strip has been successfully added to your Z-Wave network, its Network LED will become solid. If the pairing was unsuccessful, the red LED will be on for 2 seconds and then remain a colorful gradient, repeat the instructions above from step 1. 

### Exclusion Information

  1. Set your Z-Wave controller into device removal mode.
  2. Press the Action Button located on the back of the LED Strip's white controller box once.
  3. If the LED Strip has been successfully removed from your  Z-Wave network, its Network LED will remain colorful gradient. If the removal was unsuccessful, the Network LED will still be solid, repeat the instructions above from step 1.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZW121 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Notification group for strip state changes
 Use configuration parameter 80 to define what notifications this group receives.  

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Retransmit

Retransmit commands to associated nodes
Forward the Basic Set, Switch Binary Set, Switch Multilevel Start Level Change, Switch Multilevel Stop Level Change, Switch Multilevel Set, Scene Activation Set to associated nodes in this group when the LED Strip receives the Basic Set, Switch Binary Set, Switch Multilevel Start Level Change, Switch Multilevel Stop Level Change, Switch Multilevel Set, Scene Activation Set commands from the main controller. 

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.
