The ZW074 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The ZW074 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

The Aeotec by Aeon Labs MultiSensor Gen5 looks like a motion sensor and it acts like one too. But it’s also so much more. Installing this 1 piece of Z-Wave technology is the same as installing 4 pieces of Z-Wave technology. Your home control network will immediately understand motion, temperature, humidity and light readings wherever Multisensor installed. Those intelligent readings will equate to intelligence automation. And intelligent automation will give you the perfect, smart home

### Inclusion Information

Press the Z-Wave button under the Battery Cover to begin the Z-Wave pairing process.

If the MultiSensor was not successfully paired into any Z-Wave network the LED on the MultiSensor will blink when pressing the Z-Wave button. If the MultiSensor was successfully paired into a Z-Wave network, the LED will stay solid for a few seconds when pressing the Z-Wave button.

### Exclusion Information

Press the Z-Wave button under the Battery Cover to begin the Z-Wave exclusion process.

If the MultiSensor was successfully removed from the Z-Wave network, pressing the Z-Wave button will cause the LED to blink. If the MultiSensor was not successfully removed from the Z-Wave network the LED will stay solid for a few seconds

### Wakeup Information

The ZW074 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


Press and hold the Z-Wave button for 3 seconds will trigger sending the Wake up notification command. If press the Z-Wave button 3 times, the MultiSensor will wake up for 10 minutes.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the ZW074 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |

### Binary Sensor
Indicates if a sensor has triggered.

The ```sensor_binary``` channel is of type ```sensor_binary``` and supports the ```Switch``` item. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| ON | Triggered |
| OFF | Untriggered |

### Sensor (temperature)
Indicates the current temperature.

The ```sensor_temperature``` channel is of type ```sensor_temperature``` and supports the ```Number:Temperature``` item and is in the ```Temperature``` category.

### Sensor (luminance)
Indicates the current light reading.

The ```sensor_luminance``` channel is of type ```sensor_luminance``` and supports the ```Number``` item. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Sensor (relative humidity)
Indicates the current relative humidity.

The ```sensor_relhumidity``` channel is of type ```sensor_relhumidity``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Humidity``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Alarm
Indicates if an alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_general``` channel is of type ```alarm_general``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Alarm``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_255_4_wo``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.
This is a write only parameter.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZW074 supports 5 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Basic Set


Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Dimmer Start/Stop


Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 4: Dimmer Set


Association group 4 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 5: Temperature Report


Association group 5 supports 5 nodes.
