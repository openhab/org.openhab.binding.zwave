## Overview

The Aeotec Micro Smart Energy Switch G2 is a low-cost Z-Wave appliance module specifically used to enable Z-Wave command and control (on/ off) for existing in-wall switches. It can also report immediate wattage consumption or kWh energy usage over a period of time

### Inclusion Information

While the Micro Smart Energy Switch G2 is powered in a 3-wire system, the external switch/button can be toggled to initiate pairing into the Z-Wave network. Or the internal button can be pushed to initiate pairing into the Z-Wave network if the Micro Smart Energy Switch G2 was not put into in-wall box. 

Troubleshooting:

If the Aeotec Micro Smart Energy Switch G2 was not successfully included into any Z-Wave network, the LED will continually blink slowly. If the Aeotec Micro Smart Energy Switch G2 was successfully included to a Z-Wave network, the Status Indication LED will either be solid on or off depending on if the switch is on or off. 

### Exclusion Information

While the Micro Smart Energy Switch G2 is powered in a 3-wire system, the external switch/button can be toggled 10 times in quick succession to initiate removing from the Z-Wave network. Or the internal button can be pushed to initiate pairing into the Z-Wave network if Micro Smart Energy Switch G2 was not put into in-wall box.

Troubleshooting: If the Aeotec Micro Smart Energy Switch G2 was removed from the Z-Wave network, the Status Indication LED will be blinking. If the Aeotec Micro Smart Energy Switch G2 was not successfully removed from the Z-Wave network, the Status Indication LED will either be solid on or off depending on if the switch is on or off

### General Usage Information

Reset:

If Micro Smart Energy Switch G2 was not put into in-wall box, Another way to reset Aeotec Micro Smart Energy Switch G2 is pressing and holding the button which is on Micro Smart Energy Switch G2 20 seconds.
