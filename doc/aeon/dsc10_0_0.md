Heavy Duty Smart Switch Gen5 has been crafted to power connected lighting using Z-Wave Plus. It is powered by Aeotec’s Gen5 technology. 

  
To see whether Heavy Duty Smart Switch Gen5 is known to be compatible with your Z-Wave system or not, please reference our Z-Wave gateway comparison listing. The technical specifications of Heavy Duty Smart Switch Gen5can be viewed at that link.

**Familiarize**** yourself with your Heavy Duty Smart Switch Gen5.**

**Action button:** Used for Heavy Duty Smart Switch Z-Wave network inclusion and exclusion and to manually turn on or off.

**Status LED:** Indicates your Heavy Duty Smart Switch's status. (While unpaired, this LED will blink slowly constantly).

**Terminals: **There are two groups of terminals. As marked, mains power is to be connected to AC Power and the electric load to Load.

Heavy Duty Smart Switch Gen5 current can not exceed 40 amps.

### Inclusion Information

Your Heavy Duty Smart Switch must be paired with a Z-Wave network  before it can receive wireless commands or report the energy consumption of the attached electronics.

**   
** 

**Note: **The LED on your Heavy Duty Smart Switch will blink if it is not currently paired with a Z-Wave network. 

**Tip:** Turn off any devices connected to your Heavy Duty Smart Switch before adding or removing it to/from a Z-Wave network. This will help to prevent load damage. 

**Adding your Heavy Duty Smart Switch Gen5 to a Z-Wave network.**

**Pairing your **Heavy Duty Smart Switch Gen5** into your existing Z-Wave network.**

1. Place your gateway or controller into Z-Wave pair or inclusion mode. (Please refer to your controller/gateway manual on how to do this)

2. Press the Action Button on your Switch.

3. If your switch has been successfully linked to your network, its LED will no longer blink. If linking was unsuccessful, the LED will continue to blink.

### Exclusion Information

**Unpairing your Heavy Duty Smart Switch Gen5 from your existing Z-Wave network**

1. Place your gateway or controller into Z-Wave unpair or exclusion mode. (Please refer to your controller/gateway manual on how to do this)

2. Press the Action Button on your Switch.

3. If your switch has been successfully unlinked to your network, its LED will begin to blink. If linking was unsuccessful, the LED will return to its last LED state.

### General Usage Information

**Turn your Heavy Duty Smart Switch Gen5 on or off.**

Your Heavy Duty Smart Switch can be turned on or off through the use of  Z-Wave commands built into Z- Wave certified controllers and gateways. The specific Z-Wave commands supporting this function are the Basic Command Class and Binary Switch Command Class. 

**Monitoring power consumption.**

Your Heavy Duty Smart Switch can report Watts energy usage or kWh energy usage to a Z-Wave gateway or controller. If this function is supported by the gateway/controller, your energy consumption will be displayed within its user interface. The specific Z-Wave commands supporting energy monitoring are the Meter Command Class and Multilevel Sensor Command Class. Automatic reports go to association group 1, which is setup via the  Association Command Class. 

**More advanced configurations.**

The Smart Switch Gen5 has a longer list of device configurations that you can do with Smart Switch Gen5.
