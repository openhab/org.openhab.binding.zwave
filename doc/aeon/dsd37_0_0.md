The DSD37 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

Aeon Labs Range Extender is a Z-Wave repeater device based on Z-Wave enhanced 232 slave library V6.51.08.

It can extend the range of the communication between Z-Wave products and assist other devices to reach each other in your Z-Wave network.

It can be included and operated in any Z-wave network with other Z-wave certified devices from other manufacturers and/or other applications. All non-battery operated nodes within the network will act as repeaters regardless of vendor to increase reliability of the network.

It is also a security Z-Wave device and supports the Over The Air (OTA) feature for the product’s firmware upgrade.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The DSD37 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Retransmit


Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.
