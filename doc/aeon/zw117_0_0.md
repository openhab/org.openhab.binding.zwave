The ZW117 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

Aeotec Range Extender is a Z-Wave mesh network repeater which can extend the range of communication between Z-Wave products and assist other devices to reach each other in your Z-Wave network. The Range Extender can also communicate securely via AES 128 wireless Z-Wave commands and supports Over-The-Air (OTA) firmware upgrades.

Aeotec Range Extender 6 has been crafted to power connected lighting using Z-Wave Plus (http://aeotec.com/z-waveplus).  
It is powered by Aeotec’s Gen5 (http://aeotec.com/z-wave-gen5) technology. You can find out more about Range  
Extender 6 (http://aeotec.com/z-wave-repeater) by following that link.

To see whether Range Extender 6 is known to be compatible with your Z-Wave system or not, please reference our  
Z-Wave gateway comparison (http://aeotec.com/z-wave-gateways) listing. The technical specifications of Range  
Extender 6 (https://aeotec.freshdesk.com/solution/articles/6000166773-range-extender-6-technical-specifications-) can be

### Inclusion Information

# Adding your Range Extender into a Z-Wave network

  
Getting your Range Extender up and running is as simple as plugging it into a wall outlet and adding it to your Z-Wave  
network. To set your Z-Wave controller/gateway into pairing mode, please refer to the respective section within your  
controller instruction manual.

  1. Decide on where you want your Range Extender to be placed and then plug it into a wall outlet.
  2. Set your Z-Wave Controller into pairing mode.
  3. Press the Z-Wave Button on your Range Extender and quickly release the button (should only be a quick tap  
    action on the button) and its LED will blink green rapidly (green indicates insecure pairing, if you want to pair  
    securely, please refer to Enabling Security Encryption section in the Advanced Function section).
  4. If Range Extender has been successfully added to your Z-Wave network, its LED will be solid for 2 seconds  
    then turn off. If the adding was unsuccessful, the red LED will be on for 2 seconds and then remain colorful gradient  
    status, repeat the steps from step 1.

### Exclusion Information

# Removing your Range Extender from a Z-Wave network

Your Range Extender can be removed from your Z-Wave network at any time. You’ll need to use your Z-Wave  
network’s main controller. To set your Z-Wave controller/gateway into removal mode, please refer to the respective  
section within your controller instruction manual.

  1. Set your Z-Wave Controller into device removal mode.
  2. Press the Z-Wave Button on your Range Extender.
  3. If Range Extender has been successfully removed from your network, its RGB LED will remain colorful gradient  
    status. If the removal was unsuccessful, the RGB LED will still be solid, repeat the steps above.

### General Usage Information

# General LED Status

There are a few LED indications that you will need to pay attention to for the Range Extender 6.

## Unpaired from network.

  * Rainbow LED - unpaired from a network and ready to be paired to a new network

##  
While paired to an existing network.

  * LED OFF - pair to your network.
  * LED Blinks once - This is indication when your Repeater has received or repeated a command.

# Enabling Security Encryption

In order to take full advantage of all functionality the Range Extender, you may want your Range Extender is a  
security device that uses secure/encrypted message to communicate in your Z-Wave network, so a security enabled  
controller/gateway is needed.

  1. Set your Z-Wave security controller/gateway into pairing mode.
  2. Press the Z-Wave Button 2 times within 1 second and its LED will blink blue (which indicates secure pairing).
  3. If the Range Extender has been successfully added to your Z-Wave network, its blue LED will be solid for 2  
    seconds and then be off. Otherwise, repeater the steps above.

# Testing Health Connectivity

**NOTE** - This health detection function is only good for determining direct connection to the gateway (within  
communication distance to your gateway without any other repeater nodes).

You can determine the health of your Range Extender 6s connectivity to your gateway using a manual button press,  
hold, and release function which is indicated by the LED color.

  1. Press and hold Range Extender 6 Action button
  2. Wait until the RGB LED turns into a Purple Color
  3. Release Range Extender 6 Action Button

The RGB LED will blink its Purple color while sending ping messages to your gateway, when it has finished, it will blink  
1 of 3 colors:

Red = Bad Health  
Yellow = Moderate Health  
Green = Great Health

Be sure to watch for the blink, as it will only blink once very quickly.

# Manually resetting your Range Extender

If at some stage, your primary controller is missing or inoperable, you may wish to reset all of your Range Extender’s  
settings to their factory defaults. This test will attempt to directly communicate to your gateway, so if it is far away or  
requires another repeater to communicate to your gateway, this test would not work (it will show red if there is no direct  
communication possible to your gateway). To do this:

  * Press and hold the Z-Wave Button for 20 seconds to completely factory reset your Range Extender 6.
  * During the time that you are holding your Range Extender 6 action button down, the LED will blink through  
    these colors: 
      * Yellow (at 2 seconds)
      * Purple (at 5 seconds)
      * Red (at 8 seconds) //initializing factory reset.
      * Green (at 20 seconds) //factory reset complete.
      * Rainbow LED //ready to be paired to a new gateway.
  * You may let go when the LED turns green.

Your Range Extender will now be reset to its original settings, and the green LED will be solid for 2 seconds and then  
remain the colorful gradient status as a confirmation.
