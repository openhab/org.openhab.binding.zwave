The 009402 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

## Overview

This product combines a certified '10 year' stand-alone smoke detector with a plug-in Z-Wave module to form a wirelessly reporting automatically meshing smoke sensor plus wirelessly controllable indoor siren. The smoke detector is certified by the VdS for Q quality and DIN EN 14604 and satisfies all contemporary legal requirements.

The High-End 10 years smoke detector offers a test button conveniently accessible even with a broomstick when mounted on the sealing. The smoke chamber is monitored electronically to avoid any malfunction and wrong alerts. The device will also report its end of life to make sure it is getting replaced on time.

According to the VdS 3515 (smoke sensors with radio communication) this device will relay all alarms to all other smoke sensors in the Z-Wave network to create a house-wide alarm. This connection of the smoke sensors is fully automated and needs no further configuration. The smoke sensors and the controller communicate via a secure protocol to prevent manipulation. 

### Inclusion Information

  * Pressing the button 'Inclusion Button' for one second includes the device.
  * If the button is pressed for at least 2 seconds the inclusion will be done without the Security Command Class

### Exclusion Information

 A single click on the button 'Inclusion Button' will exclude the device. 

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the 009402 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Switch | switch_binary | switch_binary | Switch | Switch | 
| Binary Sensor | sensor_binary | sensor_binary |  | Switch | 
| Smoke Alarm | alarm_smoke | alarm_smoke | Smoke | Switch | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | system.battery_level | Battery | Number |

### Switch
Switch the power on and off.

The ```switch_binary``` channel is of type ```switch_binary``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Switch``` category.

### Binary Sensor
Indicates if a sensor has triggered.

The ```sensor_binary``` channel is of type ```sensor_binary``` and supports the ```Switch``` item. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| ON | Triggered |
| OFF | Untriggered |

### Smoke Alarm
Indicates if a smoke is triggered.

The ```alarm_smoke``` channel is of type ```alarm_smoke``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Smoke``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.


## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 4 configuration parameters available in the 009402.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Siren alarm sequence interval | Siren alarm sequence interval |
| 2 | Siren alarm tone length | Siren alarm tone length |
| 3 | Value of On-Command |  |
| 4 | Value of Off-Command |  |

### Parameter 1: Siren alarm sequence interval

Siren alarm sequence interval
The additional siren is creating a different acoustic signal differentiate from the smoke alarm. This sound is partly on and partly  off.

This parameter defines the total length of the interval in seconds.
Values in the range 3 to 129 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```10```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Siren alarm tone length

Siren alarm tone length
The  additional siren is creating a different acoustic signal differentiate from the smoke alarm. This sound is partly on and partly  off.

This parameter defines the total  length of the sound versus silence within this interval.
Values in the range 1 to 99 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```8```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: Value of On-Command



Values in the range 0 to 99 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```99```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 4: Value of Off-Command



Values in the range 0 to 99 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```99```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_4_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The 009402 supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 4 nodes.

### Group 2: Alarm Reports


Association group 2 supports 4 nodes.

### Group 3: Switching Command when Alarm 


Association group 3 supports 4 nodes.
