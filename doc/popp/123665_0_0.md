Values in the range 0 to 65535 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```3000```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 4: Threshold of KWh for Load caution 

Warn if Acc. Power Consumption exceeds the set value
This is a warning when the KWh of load over the preset threshold value, if the Accumulated Power Consumption exceeds the setting value the device will send a warning alarm command to the controller.
Values in the range 0 to 65535 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```10000```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_4_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.
