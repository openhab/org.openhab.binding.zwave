The 700045 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

This keypad is a security enabled Z-Wave Plus product. An security enabled Z-Wave controller must be used to fully utilize this product. The keypad allows securely controlling devices  - such as door locks   - and trigger actions in a gateway – such as arm/disarm alarm system– based on the entry of certain key codes. Additionally a bell key allows emulating a doorbell by operating e.g. a door bell or a light or both.      The device can operate in two different modes. The mode is chosen the way the device is included into a Z-Wave network:

  1. **Stand Alone Mode.** In this case the keypad acts as the primary network controller and will include other devices such as e.g. a strike lock control or a door bell. No other central controller is needed. The management of user codes is done using the keypad itself.
  2. **Network Mode.** The keypad is included as additional device into an exiting network. In Z-Wave terms it will then act as inclusion (secondary) controller. It will send commands to a central controller and is managed by this controller. In this mode the device can still directly control door locks but it can also be used to trigger scenes in a central controller. 

The device is protected by a tamper switch sending out an alarm message when the enclosure is opened.

### Inclusion Information

Turn the device into management mode by removing the back cover or typing the master code if set. Hit button 4 and confirm with * (Star Key)

### Exclusion Information

Turn the device into management mode by removing the back cover or typing the master code if set. Hit button 4 and confirm with * (Star Key)

### Wakeup Information

The 700045 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


Wakeup: Ring Key.

To issue a NIF: 0 plus * (Star Key) in Management Mode

### General Usage Information

The keypad allows typing in up to 20 different key codes and pressing certain dedicated buttons. Key codes are numbered 1...20 must have minimum 4 and maximum 10 digits as number between 0 und 9. All key codes are equal except key code #20 that will also activate the management mode. Beside the 10 numerical keys the devices offers a ENTER key (\*), an ESCAPE key (#) and a Bell key. Every key entry needs to be confirmed by "\*". Sequences can be aborted using the "#" key.  
The bell key will immediately cause ringing a bell if there is a bell devices included in association group 3.  They entry of the key code should be confirmed by "\*". If no "\*" is entered the entry will time out and use the key entered so far. This means its possible not to confirm by "*" and wait for the timeout of few seconds.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (Enabled).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_6_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The 700045 supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 10 nodes.

### Group 2: Door Lock Control


Association group 2 supports 10 nodes.

### Group 3: Ring Button Control


Association group 3 supports 10 nodes.
