The 005107 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

## Overview

This solar powered outdoor siren can be used without any additional power supply or batteries. It can be installed on any place on the outside of the house and can be controlled using Z-Wave. The device will issue a very loud sound (105 dBm) and in parallel some stroboscope light as well. The siren is self-protecting. Removing the main device from the mounting unit immediately starts the siren and also reports the tamper attempt to the ZWave central controller. All communication between the Z-Wave controller and the siren is encrypted and secured to protect against manipulation.

Thanks to the large solar panel, the siren can be mounted on nearly every place outside the house where it"s recommended to place it in indirect sun light to prevent strong heating-up the housing. The siren is maintenance-free and water-proofed (IP56). The average solar energy of one day keeps the device alive for up to 50 days (without using the siren). Additionally, an internal temperature sensor reports the temperature inside the siren’s enclosure.

### Inclusion Information

On factory default the device does not belong to any Z-Wave network. The device needs to be **added to an existing wireless network** to communicate with the devices of this network. This process is called **Inclusion**.

Devices can also be removed from a network. This process is called **Exclusion**. Both processes are initiated by the primary controller of the Z-Wave network. This controller is turned into exclusion respective inclusion mode. Inclusion and Exclusion is then performed doing a special manual action right on the device.

#### Inclusion

  1. Open the case and turn on the power switch 
  2. Remove the metal mounting plate from the device. 
  3. Turn your controller into inclusion mode with a short single click on the internal inclusion button.

### Exclusion Information

  1. Open the case and turn on the power switch 
  2. Remove the metal mounting plate from the device. 
  3. Turn your controller into inclusion mode with a short single click on the internal inclusion button.

### General Usage Information

The siren can be turned on and off using wireless commands. To protect this communication from misuse is strongly recommended to operate the siren in secure communication mode. The secure communication is activated on default during inclusion unless explicitly suppressed. When activated the siren will generate a 105 dB alarm sound and a flash light. This behavior can be configured as well using configuration parameter 5. Make sure to deactivate the tamper protection before removing an included siren from the mounting plate.

It is possible to power the Siren from an external power supply. Please use any 12 V DC power with minimum of 1 W output. The terminals marked with E ( see ill1 for more details) allows to connect the power source to the device. its recommended ot detach the cables to the solar cell in this operating mode.

The ```switch_binary``` channel is of type ```switch_binary``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Switch``` category.

### Binary Sensor
Indicates if a sensor has triggered.

The ```sensor_binary``` channel is of type ```sensor_binary``` and supports the ```Switch``` item. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| ON | Triggered |
| OFF | Untriggered |

### Sensor (temperature)
Indicates the current temperature.

The ```sensor_temperature``` channel is of type ```sensor_temperature``` and supports the ```Number:Temperature``` item and is in the ```Temperature``` category.

### Alarm
Indicates if an alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_general``` channel is of type ```alarm_general``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Alarm``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |

### Alarm (burglar)
Indicates if the burglar alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_burglar``` channel is of type ```alarm_burglar``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Door``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.


## Device Configuration

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The 005107 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Lifeline (max. nodes in group: 10)

Association group 1 supports 10 nodes.
