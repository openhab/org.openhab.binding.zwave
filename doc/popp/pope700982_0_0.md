The POPE700982 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The POPE700982 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

The POPP Door/Window Sensor is a sensor, which detects, if your window is opened, closed or tilted. The sensor is easily retroﬁttable. Furthermore, the POPP Door/Window Sensor can include other sensors by being connected with other binary sensors like NTC contacts, micro switches or ﬂood sensor. Thanks to its slim design the POPP Door/Windows can be installed unﬂashy on every window. The sensor just has to be installed on the window casement. Additionally, there has to be a slim magnet installed closely to the sensor at the window frame. By using a patented method the sensor can reliably detect the exact position of the window. With the potential free input the Door/Window Sensor can also include other sensors in your Z-Wave system. For that the binary sensor is connected to the potential free input of the sensor. Besides sensors there can also be connected momentary switches, which controls scenes in your gateway.

### Inclusion Information

Tripple click the tamper switch

### Exclusion Information

Tripple click the tamper switch

### Wakeup Information

The POPE700982 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


Tripple click the tamper switch.

### General Usage Information

Once installed the sensor will report open and close status changes to a central Z-Wave controller using notiﬁcation commands. Addtionally the sensor can directly control other device using the association group 2. Using conﬁguration commands the source of open and close events can choosen between the internal magnet detector or external dry contact connected via the screw terminal. The device is protected by a tamper switch.

The ```scene_number``` channel is of type ```scene_number``` and supports the ```Number``` item.
This channel provides the scene, and the event as a decimal value in the form ```<scene>.<event>```. The scene number is set by the device, and the event is as follows -:

| Event ID | Event Description  |
|----------|--------------------|
| 0        | Single key press   |
| 1        | Key released       |
| 2        | Key held down      |

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The POPE700982 supports 4 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Lifeline

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Control devices

Control devices when magnet or external dry contacts trips

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: send alarm message 

sends our alarm message when magnet controlled or external dry sensor trips

Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 4: send tamper alarm

sends alarm messages when tamper is tripped

Association group 4 supports 5 nodes.
