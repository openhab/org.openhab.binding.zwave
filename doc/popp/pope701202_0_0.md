The POPE701202 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The POPE701202 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

Product Description  
  
This device measures the three air quality parameters temperature, humidity and dew point an reports them to a central controller. Beside this, the device can directly control groups of other Z-Wave devices on over- and undershooting a set temperature and/or humidity parameter. This can be used to establish control loops for temperature and humidity. The device wakes up every 4 minutes to measure the values and it will send unsolicited reports when values change. Additionally, the device will report all values on request.  
The mold detector is actively monitoring the danger of mold in a room based on the temperature and humidity and will issue alarm warnings when critical air conditions met. Wireless Alarm and red and a green blinking LED will indicate a mold condition. This local LED warning function is also available when the device is not included in any Z-Wave network and works stand alone.

The POPP Mold Detector can be mounted in two ways.

  1. use the enclosed adhesive tape. Clean the substrate carefully from grease and dirt to achieve optimum strength of the adhesive areas.
  2. use the enclosed screws and dowels to fix it to the wall or other surface.

### Inclusion Information

On factory default the device does not belong to any Z-Wave network. The device needs to be added to an existing wireless network to communicate with the devices of this network. This process is called Inclusion.  
  
Tripple clicking the tamper button includes (adds) the device.

### Exclusion Information

Devices can also be removed from a network. This process is called Exclusion. Both processes are initiated by the primary controller of the Z-Wave network. This controller is turned into exclusion respective inclusion mode. Inclusion and Exclusion is then performed doing a special manual action right on the device.

Tripple clicking the tamper button excludes (removes) the device.

### Wakeup Information

The POPE701202 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


# Communication to a Sleeping device (Wakeup)

**A triple click (3 cliecks) on the tamper button will wakeup the device**.

  
This device is battery operated and turned into deep sleep state most of the time to save battery life time. Communication with the device is limited. In order to communicate with the device, a static controller C is needed in the network. This controller will maintain a mailbox for the battery operated devices and store commands that can not be received during deep sleep state. Without such a controller, communication may become impossible and/or the battery life time is significantly decreased.  
  
This device will wakeup regularly and announce the wakeup state by sending out a so called Wakeup Notification. The controller can then empty the mailbox. Therefore, the device needs to be configured with the desired wakeup interval and the node ID of the controller. If the device was included by a static controller this controller will usually perform all necessary configurations. The wakeup interval is a tradeoff between maximal battery life time and the desired responses of the device. To wakeup the device please perform the following action: 

### General Usage Information

Open the  POPP Mold Detector  
To open the POPP Mold Detector, press the lock with your finger and pull the housing cover upwards.  
  
Tamper button  
The tamper button is located on the side of the POPP Mold Detector. This button is also used for inclusion and exclusion.  
  
Functionality   
Once the device is powered up it will start monitoring the air parameters and warn of mold using the local red and green LED. All air parameters are measured every 4 minutes. Pushing the button will force an immediate measurement and the LEDs will indicate the danger of mold

  * green: no danger of mold in the room
  * red: danger of mold, on the windows to lower the humidity

The device contains three sensors with the following accuracy measures:

  * Humidity: +/- 3 % on relative humidity, +/-1 % hysteresis
  * Temperature: 0 ... 65 °C +/- 1 Kelvin
  * Dew Point: 0 ... 65 °C +/- 1 Kelvin (calculated from other sensor values)

Besides the measured values the device will issue Z-Wave notifications on moisture (0x10).  
  
Node Information Frame  
The Node Information Frame (NIF) is the business card of a Z-Wave device. It contains information about the device type and the technical capabilities. The inclusion and exclusion of the device is confirmed by sending out a Node Information Frame. Beside this it may be needed for certain network operations to send out a Node Information Frame. To issue a NIF execute the following action: Tripple Click the tamper button

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The POPE701202 supports 5 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Lifeline

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Temperature High Trigger

Temperature High Trigger

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Temperature Low Trigger

Temperature Low Trigger

Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 4: Humidity High Trigger

Humidity High Trigger

Association group 4 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 5: Humidity Low Trigger

Humidity Low Trigger

Association group 5 supports 5 nodes.
