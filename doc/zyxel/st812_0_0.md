# ST812 Flood sensor
This describes the Z-Wave device *ST812*, manufactured by *ZyXEL* with the thing type UID of ```zyxel_st812_00_000```.

The device is in the category of *Sensor*, defining Device used to measure something.

The ST812 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The ST812 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

The Flood Detector consists of a transceiver, flood sensor and 3-meter flood sensor cable. Protect your property from water damage! The Flood Detector is designed to sense the presence of water in basements, yachts and many others residential and commercial applications, providing early warning of developing floods. The Flood Detector is designed so that the transceiver is mounted on the wall and the flood sensor is placed in a location where water presence, such as a result of leakage or flooding, is probable. Upon flood detection, the Detector will beep and flash and report its status to the node ID. Once water is released, it will report to the node ID as well. 

### Inclusion Information

Pressing link key three times within 1.5 second will enter inclusion mode.

The detector will stay “awake” for 10 minutes to allow time for setting and device status enquiring.

### Exclusion Information

Pressing link key three times within 1.5 second will enter exclusion mode.

The detector will stay “awake” for 10 minutes to allow time for setting and device status enquiring.

### Wakeup Information

The ST812 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the ST812 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Battery Level | battery-level | system.battery_level | Battery | Number |
| Alarm (flood) | alarm_flood | alarm_flood | Water | Switch | 

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.
### Alarm (flood)
Indicates if the flood alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_flood``` channel is of type ```alarm_flood``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Water``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |



## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 1 configuration parameters available in the ST812.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Basic Level Set | The value sent with Basic commands in case of detected flood |
|  | Wakeup Interval | Sets the interval at which the device will accept commands from the controller |
|  | Wakeup Node | Sets the node ID of the device to receive the wakeup notifications |

### Parameter 1: Basic Level Set

The value sent with Basic commands in case of detected flood
0 = Off

1-99 = On (Binary Switch Device),  Dim Level (Multilevel Switch Device)
The following option values may be configured, in addition to values in the range 0 to 99 -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Off |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```99```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ST812 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Power applied and Sensor Alarm

The Detector will send ALARM_REPORT command to the nodes of Group 1 to inform the devices that the Detector is powered up.

ALARM_REPORT Command: [Command Class Alarm, Alarm Type = 0x02, Alarm Level = 0x01]

The second type for Group 1 is SENSOR\_ALARM\_REPORT.  255 = Alarm, 00 = Event clear.

The third type for Group 1 is ALARM_REPORT type 0x01, Low battery

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Device control

Group to send trigger value to
Will send values of 0-99 to devices in Group 2.  Set the value to send in Parameter 1.

Association group 2 supports 3 nodes.
