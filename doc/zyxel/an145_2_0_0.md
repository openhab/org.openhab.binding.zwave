The Everspring Lamp Holder AN145-2 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

The AN145 screw-in on/off module is a lamp holder and a transceiver which is a Z-Wave enabled device. It is fully compatible with any Z-Wave enabled network.
