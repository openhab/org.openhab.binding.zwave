## Overview

Touchscreen Deadbolt with Alarm

### Inclusion Information

One-button Add lock to Z-Wave Network (Inclusion) 1.Place your home automation system or panel into the Add or Inclusion Mode (Refer to the respective documentation for that specific home automation system or panel device for details). 2.Remove the battery cover of the deadbolt. 3.Press then release the button on the PCB.4.An LED will flash amber indicating the Add or Inclusion process is in progress. If the Security Scheme is Security 2 (S2), verify the DSK of the lock at the Z-Wave Controller. The PIN Code portion of the Z-Wave DSK will be needed.5.When a green LED turns ON, the Add or Inclusion has completed successfully. 6. If a red LED turns ON, try repeating steps 1-3

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The BE468ZP supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
One device controls an other device
Z-Wave devices control other Z-Wave devices. The relationship between one device controlling another device is called association. In order to control a different device, the controlling device needs to maintain a list of devices that will receive controlling commands. These lists are called association groups and they are always related to certain events (e.g. button pressed, sensor triggers, ...). In case the event happens all devices stored in the respective association group will receive the same wireless command wireless command, typically a 'Basic Set' Command.

Association group 1 supports 2 nodes.
