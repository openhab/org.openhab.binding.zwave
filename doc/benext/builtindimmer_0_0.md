## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The builtInDimmer supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Group 1

All nodes in this group will receive a BASIC_SET frame
All nodes in this group will receive a BASIC_SET frame when light is set to a certain state with the button of the Built-in Dimmer (manual switching).

When light is switched off with button: BASIC_SET frame with value 0 is sent to associated nodes.

When light is set to a dim level with button: BASIC_SET frame with value 0 – 99 is sent to associated nodes.

When light is switched on with button: BASIC_SET frame with value 255 is sent to associated nodes.

It is most likely that switch\_binary/switch\_multilevel devices are associated in this group so that you can switch multiple nodes on/off with 1 button pres

Association group 1 supports 8 nodes.

### Group 2: Group 2

The node associated in this group will receive a SWITCH\_MULTILEVEL\_REPORT frame every time the level of light is changed, where the value represents the (changed) dim level. The status is reported after every change that means manual but also if changed by Z-Wave.

The node in this group will also received the (auto) METER\_REPORT (see § COMMAND\_CLASS\_METER à unsolicited METER\_REPORT for more information about this feature).

It is most likely that a controller or screen is associated in this group to report (unsolicited) any changes to the light.

Association group 2 supports 1 node.

### Group 3: Group 3

If configured that the control mode is extern only (configuration param3 à value 1) then a BASIC\_SET frame is sent to the node in this group when the button is changed. Note that the light of the Built-in Dimmer is not switched on/off but instead the BASIC\_SET frame is sent, because the Built-in Dimmer doesn’t know what the extern status is the value of the BASIC_SET frame toggles between the values 0 and 255.

It is most likely that a Gateway (controller) is associated in this group. A Gateway can handle upon the received frame. With a Gateway controlled network it possible to add multiple functionalities to the button of the Builtin Dimmer.

Association group 3 supports 1 node.
