The BEN_80822002 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The BEN_80822002 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

The BeNext Panic Button is a small panic button meant for wearing as a necklace. It has a big red SOS button, and a lock and unlock button. In newer versions, the buttons are colored.   
The device is only available in the EU region. 

### Inclusion Information

  1. Press and hold the red SOS button until the LED starts blinking once every second. 
  2. Release the button.
  3. The LED blinks 2 times every second indicating the inclusion process is going on.
  4. When included succesfully, the LED is on for one second.

When classic inclusion fails, network wide inclusion will be tried. 

Inclusion usually takes a few minutes, but sometimes last longer, up to some hours. In the last case, manually wake up the devices several times (by pressing the red SOS button for 5 seconds), until the configuration is finished.

### Exclusion Information

  1. Press and hold the red SOS button until the LED starts blinking once every second. 
  2. Then release the button.
  3. The LED blinks 3 times every 1,5 second indicating the exclusion process is going on.
  4. When excluded successfully, the LED is on for one second. 

### Wakeup Information

The BEN_80822002 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


Hold the red SOS Button for approximately 5 seconds. As a side effect, the SOS alarm will be toggled.

### General Usage Information

The SOS button works like a toggle. When the alarm is OFF, a button press of 1 second (default time, configurable) will put it ON. If ON, the alarm will be toggled OFF (cancelled). The LED will confirm that: it is on for 1 second (default time, configurable).  

The indicator light gives various statuses of the device as follows:

  1. Ready for inclusion: LED blinks every second
  2. Inclusion in progress: LED blinks for 2 times every second
  3. Exclusion in progress: LED blinks 3 times every 1.5 second
  4. Inclusion or exclusion mode success: LED is on for one second  
    
  5. Message (i.e. button press) has been send successfully: LED is on for one second
  6. Message (i.e. button press) send failed, no association is set, or other error condition: LED blinks 6 times rapidly

There is no factory reset procedure. This is confirmed by the manufacturer. The only way to reset is to do an exclusion. This can be done with any Z-wave controller,  no matter which Z-wave controller you used for the inclusion.

### Parameter 1: Set to default

Set all configuration values to default values (factory default)
When you write 255 (0xFF) to this parameter, all configurable values are set back to their defaults. After some time, at the next wake up, the device will "answer" that by making the value -86 again (input is 0 to 255, but output is -128 to  +127, in 2's complement notation)

If this value is -86 (0xAA), the configuration of the device is default.  
If this value is 85 (0x55), the configuration of the device has been changed.

Note:  If this value is on -86, and you make a change in the other configuration parameters, the OpenHab PaperUI prevent this, as the number must be between 0 and 255. You can circumvent that by making this parameter for instance 1 (or any other value, as long as that is not 
Values in the range 0 to 0 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Min time to press panic button

Minimum time to press the panic button before an alarm will be send
The time the panic button must be pressed before an alarm message is sent out. Unit is 10 ms, so 100 is 1 second.

In case of 0, send an alarm message immediately.   
In case of 1 - 255, send an alarm message after this value * 10 ms

Default is  100 (1 second).
Values in the range 0 to 255 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```100```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: Min LED on time after panic

Minimum time that LED will be on after an alarm message
Specifies the minimum time the LED is on after an alarm message has been sent.  Unit is 10 ms, so 100 = 1 second. 

Default is 100 (1 second). 
Values in the range 0 to 255 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```100```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 4: Buttons mapped

Specifies what message will be sent in case of a key is pressed
**_Alarm mode_ if 0:   
** SOS button sends an ALARM_REPORT to nodes in group 1  
LOCK button sends a BASIC_SET with value 255 to nodes in group 1  
UNLOCK button sends a BASIC_SET with value 0 to nodes in group 1  


**_Control mode_ if 1-255:  
** SOS button sends a BASIC_SET with value 255 to nodes in group 1  
LOCK button sends a BASIC_SET with value 255 to nodes in group 2  
UNLOCK button sends a BASIC_SET with value 0 to nodes in group 2**  
**
Values in the range 0 to 0 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_4_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 5: Min time to press control buttons

Minimum time the control buttons must be pressed before a message is sent
Specifies the minimum time the lock and unlock buttons must be pressed, before a control message is sent to the controller. Unit is 10 ms, so 100 is 1 second.

Default is 10 (that is 100 ms)
Values in the range 0 to 0 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```10```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_5_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 6: Min LED on time after control

Minimum time that LED will be on after a control message
The time the LED will be on after a control message has been sent out. Unit is 10 ms, so for instance 100 is 1 second.

In case of 0, LED will be on while sending the message  
In case of 1 - 255, LED will be on during send time + _this value_ * 10 ms.  
  
 Default is 50 (500 ms)
Values in the range 0 to 255 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```50```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_6_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The BEN_80822002 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Alarm

Alarm mode group
This group is used for the alarm mode.  
  
Pressing the SOS button or the lock and unlock button will generate a message in group 1 .   
Pressing lock and unlock only generates a  message in group 1 when in alarm mode

Association group 1 supports 8 nodes.

### Group 2: Control

Lock and unlock button report group in control mode
Lock and unlock button are reported in group 2, when config parameter 4 is set to a value other than 0 (control mode).    
In control mode, SOS button is reported in group 1.

Association group 2 supports 8 nodes.
