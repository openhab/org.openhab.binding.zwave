The Tag Reader supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The Tag Reader does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

Basic operations

  * The Tag Reader 500 is a security enabled Z-Wave Plus product.
  * The Tag Reader 500 can arm/disarm a security system.
  * The Tag Reader 500 can read RFID-tags.
  * The Tag Reader 500 has the possibility for the user to manually insert codes.
  * The Tag Reader 500’s indicator light will react differently on each action.
  * The Tag Reader 500 has a buzzer, which can be used as walk-in/walk-out notification (alarm is being disabled/activated).

### Inclusion Information

  1. Press and hold the enter button for two seconds (indication LED blinks shortly) and release to start the add routine.
  2. The indication LED will start blinking twice when the Tag Reader 500 starts the add routine.

### Exclusion Information

  1. Press and hold the enter button for two seconds (indication LED blinks shortly) and release to start the remove routine.
  2. The indication LED will blink 3 times when the Tag Reader 500 starts the remove routine

### Wakeup Information

The Tag Reader does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


The enter button is pressed for 4 seconds. (led will go on for 1 second to confirm).

This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.


## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 6 configuration parameters available in the Tag Reader.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Set to Default | Set all configuration values to default values (factory settings) |
| 2 | Feedback time | the time the beep goes to off |
| 3 | Feedback time-out | waiting for the wake-up-no-more command |
| 4 | feedback beeps per second | Amount of beeps a second |
| 5 | Mode  | To configure mode |
| 6 | RFID circuit start-up time | The time the RFID will be started after pressing "home" or "away" |
|  | Wakeup Interval | Sets the interval at which the device will accept commands from the controller |
|  | Wakeup Node | Sets the node ID of the device to receive the wakeup notifications |

### Parameter 1: Set to Default

Set all configuration values to default values (factory settings)
If the Value is set to 0xFF (255) this device will return to factory settings.
Values in the range 0 to 255 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Feedback time

the time the beep goes to off
0x00 = Off, 0xFF = endless
Values in the range 0 to 255 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```15```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: Feedback time-out

waiting for the wake-up-no-more command
Too configure the time-out, waiting on the wakeup\_no\_more_information command before the error sound starts automatically. The error sound is set to 8 short beeps.

0x00 = off
Values in the range 0 to 255 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 4: feedback beeps per second

Amount of beeps a second
To set the amount of beeps per second, every beep is around 10ms.
Values in the range 0 to 5 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```2```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_4_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 5: Mode 

To configure mode
Mode 1 =  normal working mode

Mode 3 = z-wave chip is always on to be asked for information, for example version or manufacturer ID.

Any other value will be reported after a GET, but will be seen as a mode 1.
Values in the range 0 to 255 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_5_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 6: RFID circuit start-up time

The time the RFID will be started after pressing "home" or "away"
0x64 (100 * 10 ms = 1 s)

The time (*10 ms) the RFID circuit waits to start after "home" or "away" has been pressed.

the time *10 miliseconds, minimum = 0 seconds, max = 2,55 seconds. If the value is not in the allowed size the frame will be ignored.
Values in the range 0 to 255 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```100```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_6_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The Tag Reader supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Association group 1

Link devices to the tag reader
This class can be used to link other devices to the tag reader. These devices also get the burglar frame send to them.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.
