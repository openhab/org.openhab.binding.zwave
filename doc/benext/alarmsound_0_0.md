## Overview

The Alarm Sound is a plug&play product developed by BeNext. Depending on present situations and scenes it sets off an alarm sound warning you and your family or scaring off unwanted activities. Use the Alarm Sound for security purposes and notifications indoors.

Use the Alarm Sound in combination with the Door Sensor or MoLite Sensor to alert you when someone undesirably enters your home or work-space. The Alarm Sound possesses six different sound- and lighting-configurations to scare off any possible intruder. You can also customize personal preferred ‘scenes’ and ‘rules’ in our free of charge online manager in order to give the Alarm Sound dual functionality. You can even choose to create a new kind of alarm clock, which in combination with the Door Sensor or MoLite Sensor gives a wake up alarm if you haven’t left your bedroom after 09:00 am.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The Alarm Sound supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Association group 1

Changes the LED on the device
When the device receives an binary switch/ basic report, this will update the LED

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Association group 2

The alarm sound reports it status to the associated devices
- In case the device gets unplugged this shall send Alarm report (code 3, Triggered).

- When the device is connected to the power, this shall send an Alarm report (code 3, off).

- When the device is truned of by clicking on the button, this shall send a Switch binary (off).

- When the device gets unplugged the standard "power offline" sound is on, the device will send a Switch binary report (on).

When the Device is connected to a powersupply, the device will say it has connection to the associated devices in group 2. when the connection is succesful the led will be on for 1 second. If the device cannot make a connection the led will blink 6 times. If the led doesn't go on there is no device in this association group.

Association group 2 supports 1 node.
