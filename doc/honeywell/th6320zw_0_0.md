| 10 | EM Heat Type |  |
| 11 | Fossil Kit Control |  |
| 12 | Auto Changeover |  |

### Parameter 1: Schedule Type

On-thermostat schedule type

The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |

The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Electric |
| 1 | Gas/Oil |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Electric).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_10_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 11: Fossil Kit Control



The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |

Values in the range 0 to 1 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_12_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The TH6320ZW supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Z-Wave Plus Lifeline

Association group 1 supports 1 node.
