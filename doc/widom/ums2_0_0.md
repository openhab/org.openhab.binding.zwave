The UMS2 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

WiDom Smart Roller Shutter is an "in wall device", for the multilevel control of roller shutter motors. It can accurately control the opening and closing of blinds, curtains, shutters, venetian blinds as requested by the user through local commands or remotely using computers, smartphones, tablets. At the same time, it is completely configurable so that it can adapt to the most varied customers’ needs, while being ready for use without needing additional configurations in order to operate.  After an initial calibration procedure, thanks to a proprietary algorithm, WiDom Smart Roller Shutter is able to identify the exact position of the roller shutter without using external sensors. During the operation, a continuous and automatic control of the limit switches allows maintaining the calibration. In the absence of a power source, the system runs a self-repositioning procedure that restores calibration. The device is equipped with contact protection technology (Zero Crossing) which reduces the electrical stress on the relay contacts and ensures a longer life. The open / closed switching of the device always occur when the instantaneous value of voltage is 0. 

It operates in any Z-Wave network with other Z-Wave/Z-Wave Plus certified devices and controllers from any other manufacturer. As a constantly powered node, WiDom Smart Roller Shutter will act as repeater regardless of the vendor in order to increase the reliability of the network.

### Inclusion Information

Before including the device the LED status indicator is solid RED. The procedure of inclusion is activated by clicking Add in the inclusion interface and by pressing any sequence of click on the integrated button. As soon as the inclusion procedure initiates the LED indicator starts a sequence of GREEN-BLUE blinks. 

### Exclusion Information

The procedure of exclusion can be activated by Removing a node from the Z-Wave network and any click sequence on the integrated button; as soon as the exclusion initiates, the LED indicator starts a sequence of RED-BLUE blinks. The device is excluded from the network when the LED status indicator is solid RED

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The UMS2 supports 4 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 8 nodes.

### Group 2: 1 Click


Association group 2 supports 8 nodes.

### Group 3: 2 Clicks


Association group 3 supports 8 nodes.

### Group 4: 3 Clicks


Association group 4 supports 8 nodes.
