The WSP1 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

WiDom Smart Plug is able to detect overvoltage and/or overcurrent events and indicate them through a multicolor LED. Furthermore, it protects appliances from eventual overload. A very innovative design, which integrates a complex system that allows a precise energy consumption monitoring. The integration of these features in its very small size product, make it unique on the market.

The device is equipped with contact protection technology (_Zero Crossing_) which reduces the electrical stress on the relay contacts and ensures a longer life. The open / closed switching of the device always occur when the instantaneous value of voltage is 0.

It operates in any Z-Wave network with other Z-Wave/Z-Wave Plus certified devices and controllers from any other manufacturer. As a constantly powered node, WiDom Smart Plug will act as repeater regardless of the vendor in order to increase the reliability of the network.

### Inclusion Information

If the device is not included into a Z-Wave network, **three consecutive clicks** on the Push Button will launch the process of traditional inclusion. If the device inclusion procedure does not start within 2 seconds, the Network Wide Inclusion network will be launched and will last between 15-30 seconds.

### Exclusion Information

After activating the exclusion function by the controller, the device can be removed by setting it in _Exclusion_ _Mode_ by **three consecutive clicks** on the Push Button.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Level used to control group 4 

Level used to control group 4
Defines how to control the devices associated to 1 click event.
Values in the range -1 to 100 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```100```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: Level used to control group 5

Values in the range -1 to 100 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```100```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 4: Overvoltage level 

Overvoltage level
Defines the voltage level (in Volts) beyond which an overvoltage event is identified and the overvoltage timer is activated. The timer is reset when the event ceases, i.e. when the voltage returns below the overvoltage level. As soon as an overvoltage event occurs, the LED starts a _BLUE_ blinking. If the overvoltage event ceases before the overvoltage timer expires, the blue blinking is stopped, otherwise the alarm is generated and the blinking reset is established by parameter 6.
Values in the range 110 to 260 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```253```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_4_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_11_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The WSP1 supports 5 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Lifeline: Nodes belonging to this groups will receive changes related to the relay status and power consumption

Association group 1 supports 8 nodes.

### Group 2: Over Current

Over Current: Nodes belonging to this groups will be controlled by a basic set if over current event occurs

Association group 2 supports 8 nodes.

### Group 3: Over Voltage

Over Voltage: Nodes belonging to this groups will be controlled by a basic set if over voltage event occurs

Association group 3 supports 8 nodes.

### Group 4: Control 1 Click

Control 1 Click: Nodes belonging to this groups will be controlled by a basic set if the button receives one click

Association group 4 supports 8 nodes.

### Group 5: Control 2 Clicks

Control 2 Clicks: Nodes belonging to this groups will be controlled by a basic set if the button receives two clicks

Association group 5 supports 8 nodes.
