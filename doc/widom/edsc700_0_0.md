The EDSC700 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

The Energy Driven Switch C 7 is a device designed to monitor all **parameters**, **usage**, **faults** and **overloads** of your electrical system. Unlike ordinary energy meters, it is a bi-directional meter capable of measuring both the consumed and produced power, equipped with a relay that can be activated to initiate specific scenarios in relation to detected power levels.

The device is equipped with an external current transformer and can measure powers over 10 KW.

**• Active Energy-saving management**

Automatically connects and disconnects a specific load if the established threshold limit is exceeded, or supplies the required power, momentarily excluding non-priority loads.

**• Management and prevention of electrical faults**

Identifies malfunctions based on irregular consumption and to the maximum time of activity.

**• Electrical overload management**

Notifies or disconnects non-priority loads in the eventuality of system overloads.

Similarly to the other Smart Series 7 devices, it can be fully integrated into pre-existing systems and configured in full integration with the Z-Wave home automation ecosystem.

At the same time, it is completely configurable so that it can adapt to the most varied needs while also being ready to be used without needing additional configurations in order to operate.

The device is equipped with contact protection technology (Zero Crossing) which reduces the electrical stress on the relay contacts and ensures a longer life. The open / closed switching of the device always occur when the instantaneous value of voltage is 0.

It operates in any Z-Wave network with other Z-Wave/Z-Wave Plus certified devices and controllers from any other manufacturer. As a constantly powered node, the device will act as repeater regardless of the vendor in order to increase the reliability of the network.

### Inclusion Information

All Smart Series 7 devices are compatible with all Z-Wave/Z-Wave Plus certified controllers. The devices support both the** _Network Wide Inclusion_** mechanism (which offers the ability to be included in a network, even if the device is not directly connected to the controller) and **_Normal Inclusion_**.

By default, the inclusion procedure starts in **_Normal Inclusion_** mode and after a short timeout the procedure continues in **_Network Wide Inclusion_** mode that lasts for about 20 Seconds.

Only a controller can add the device into the network. After activating the inclusion function by the controller, the device can be added by setting it in **_Learn Mode_**.

Before including the device, the LED status indicator is solid RED. The adding of a device is executed by activating the adding procedure in the inclusion section of the controller interface and executing 1 or 3 click on the integrated **_button_** (the device is set in _**Learn Mode**_). As soon as the inclusion procedure initiates the LED indicator starts a sequence of GREEN-BLUE blinks. The device is included in the network when the LED status is OFF and the interview is completed.

### Exclusion Information

Only a controller can remove the device from the network. After activating the exclusion function by the controller, the device can be removed by setting it in **Learn Mode**.

The procedure of exclusion can be activated by **Removing** a node from the Z-Wave network and executing 1 or 3 click on the integrated button; as soon as the exclusion initiates, the LED indicator starts a sequence of RED-BLUE blinks. The device is excluded from the network when the LED status indicator is solid RED.

### General Usage Information

The Energy Driven Switch C 7 can implement an active energy saving policy by managing electric loads in order to maximize the self-consumption during the greater production period of a wind power or photovoltaic plant, optimizing the net metering and the energy saving. Refer to the configuration section for the parameter details.

The system implements a control logic of the associated loads through load controlled directly by the integrated relay, and the association groups which is based on the following logic:

* The Up Power G1 and Up Power G2 groups are controlled if an Up Power event occurs.

* The Down Power G1 and Down Power G2 groups are controlled if a Down Power event occurs.

The Up Power and Down Power events are defined based on the power value _above_ / _below_ a certain level, over a certain period of time.

Both the power levels and the time thresholds of permanence are defined by the user.

In case the device recognizes an UP/DOWN Power event threshold, it tries to overcome the situation, by controlling in sequence the:

1. Integrated relay

2. UP/DOWN G1 group

3. UP/DOWN G2 group

The command sent during the controlling sequence can be configured by the user as the first timeout generates the event and the next timeout passes at the next controlling step.

The _Up/Down Power First Timeout_ is always to be considered as Local Control on the relay, even if the relay is not connected to a load.

The _Up/Down Power Next Timeout_ is always to be considered for both G1 and G2 groups in sequence after the Local Up/Down Power First Timeout.

The minimum time after which the group that has been commanded can be re-commanded, is defined as Protection Time.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The EDSC700 supports 5 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Life Line Group

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Up Power Detected G1

G1 and G2 group are controlled in sequence, after a user defined delay, in the case of an Up Power event


Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Up Power Detected G2

G1 and G2 group are controlled in sequence, after a user defined delay, in the case of an Up Power event


Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 4: Down Power Detected G1

G1 and G2 group are controlled in sequence, after a user defined delay, in the case of a Down Power event


Association group 4 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 5: Down Power Detected G2

G1 and G2 group are controlled in sequence, after a user defined delay, in the case of a Down Power event


Association group 5 supports 5 nodes.
