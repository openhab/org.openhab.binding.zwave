The WDS2 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

WiDom Smart Double Switch is an ON/OFF control device designed to independently control two separate loads, suited for being controlled by both remote and local switches. Similarly to the other WiDom “in wall” devices, it can be fully integrated into pre-existing systems and configured to associate configurable behaviors to a specific number of clicks, in full integration with the Z-Wave home automation ecosystem. There are two versions of WiDom Double Switch: L version controlled by Line signal; N version controlled by Neutral signal

### Inclusion Information

Before including the device the LED status indicator is solid RED. The procedure of inclusion is activated by clicking Add in the inclusion interface and by pressing any sequence of click on the integrated button. As soon as the inclusion procedure initiates the LED indicator starts a sequence of GREEN-BLUE blinks. The device is included in the network when the LED status is OFF and the interview is completed. 

### Exclusion Information

Only a controller can remove the device from the network. After activating the exclusion function by the controller, the device can be removed by setting it in Learning Mode. If you are using the WiDom Multi Sensor Room Controller, the procedure of exclusion can be activated by Removing a node from the Z-Wave network and any click sequence on the integrated button; as soon as the exclusion initiates, the LED indicator starts a sequence of RED-BLUE blinks. The device is excluded from the network when the LED status indicator is solid RED and the App_status in the interface is OK. 

### General Usage Information

Control Actions :

  * Holding the I1/I2 button change the status of Channel1/Channel2 and return to previous status as soon as the button is released.
  * A single and/or more clicks (Parameter No.1) on the I1 button turn ON/OFF the Channel 1 load.
  * A single and/or more clicks (Parameter No.2 and No. 1) on the button I2 turn ON/OFF the Channel 2 load.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The WDS2 supports 7 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 8 nodes.

### Group 2: 1 click Button S1


Association group 2 supports 8 nodes.

### Group 3: 2 clicks Button S1


Association group 3 supports 8 nodes.

### Group 4: 3 clicks Button S1


Association group 4 supports 8 nodes.

### Group 5: 1 click Button S2


Association group 5 supports 8 nodes.

### Group 6: 2 clicks Button S2


Association group 6 supports 8 nodes.

### Group 7: 3 clicks Button S2


Association group 7 supports 8 nodes.
