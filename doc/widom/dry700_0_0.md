The DRY700 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

The Smart Dry Contact Switch 7 can **turn ON and OFF equipments with an independent power supply**, such as solenoid valves (e.g. gas, water and irrigation), power operated valves, etc.

It is very easy to install and **works with both momentary and toggle switches**.

It operates in any Z-Wave network with other Z-Wave/Z-Wave Plus certified devices and controllers from any other manufacturer. As a constantly powered node, the device will act as repeater regardless of the vendor in order to increase the reliability of the network.

This device is a security enabled Z-Wave Plus product that is able to use encrypted Z-Wave Plus messages to communicate to other security enabled Z-Wave Plus products. It must be used in conjunction with a Security Enabled Z-Wave Controller in order to fully utilize all implemented functions.

The device has the unique feature **Offline setup Mode** that allows to configure some parameters without using any user interface. This feature enables the professional user to setup the main features of the device in the field even if the device is not included in a Z-Wave Network. When the device will be included in the network all these configuration parameters will be maintained.

### Inclusion Information

All Smart Series 7 devices are compatible with all Z-Wave/Z-Wave Plus certified controllers. The devices support both the **_Network Wide Inclusion_** mechanism (which offers the ability to be included in a network, even if the device is not directly connected to the controller) and **_Normal Inclusion_**.

By default, the inclusion procedure starts in **_Normal Inclusion_** mode and after a short timeout the procedure continues in _**Network Wide Inclusion**_ mode that lasts for about 20 Seconds.

Only a controller can add the device into the network. After activating the inclusion function by the controller, the device can be added by setting it in _**Learn Mode**_.

Before including the device, the LED status indicator is solid RED. The adding of a device is executed by activating the adding procedure in the inclusion section of the controller interface and executing 1 or 3 click on the integrated _**button**_ (the device is set in **_Learn Mode_**). As soon as the inclusion procedure initiates the LED indicator starts a sequence of GREEN-BLUE blinks. The device is included in the network when the LED status is OFF and the interview is completed.

### Exclusion Information

Only a controller can remove the device from the network. After activating the exclusion function by the controller, the device can be removed by setting it in **_Learn Mode_**.

The procedure of exclusion can be activated by **_Removing_** a node from the Z-Wave network and executing 1 or 3 click on the integrated button; as soon as the exclusion initiates, the LED indicator starts a sequence of RED-BLUE blinks. The device is excluded from the network when the LED status indicator is solid RED.

### General Usage Information

For the operation of the device within the Z-Wave network and controlling the loads connected to the device, control actions are performed on the switch.

The **CONTROL ACTIONS** are **EVENTS** executed on the **EXTERNAL SWITCH **connected to the Line Signal terminal of the device which can be _Clicks_, _Hold Down_ and _Up_.

Event: **Click**, type of switch: _momentary switch (button)_, actions on the switch: _press briefly and release (when pressed it autonomously returns to the initial position)_

Event: **Click**, type of switch: _toggle switch (bistable)_, actions on the switch: _press and release (single click means one single flip of the switch)_

Event: **MultiClick** = **n clicks**, type of switch: _momentary switch or toggle switch_, actions on the switch: _sequence of consecutive n clicks_

Event: **Hold Down**, type of switch: _momentary switch_, actions on the switch: _press longer than click (after a Hold Down always follows an Up event)_

Event: **Up**, type of switch: _momentary switch_, actions on the switch: _release (the event applies only if there has been a previous Hold Down event)_

Since the device supports Central Scene Notification all the events described here will be notified with a Central Scene Notification Report to the lifeline. The events that trigger a Central Scene Notification Report can be customized with the configuration parameter in the Central Scene Notification Parameter section.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The DRY700 supports 5 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Life Line Group

Association group 1 supports 8 nodes.

### Group 2: Follow me

The state of the output (ON/OFF) will be propagated to the associated device

Association group 2 supports 8 nodes.

### Group 3: Clicks on button G1



Association group 3 supports 8 nodes.

### Group 4: Clicks on button G2



Association group 4 supports 8 nodes.

### Group 5: Dimming group

The devices will be controlled by dimming commands

Association group 5 supports 8 nodes.
