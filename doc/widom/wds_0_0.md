# WDS Universal Double Switch
This describes the Z-Wave device *WDS*, manufactured by *wiDom* with the thing type UID of ```widom_wds_00_000```.

The device is in the category of *Wall Switch*, defining Any device attached to the wall that controls a binary status of something, for ex. a light switch.

The WDS supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

Universal Double Switch is an ON/OFF control device designed to independently control two separate loads, suited for use as both a local and remote switch. Similarly to the other WiDom “in wall” devices, it can be fully integrated into pre-existing systems and configured to associate configurable behaviours to a specific number of clicks, in full integration with the Z-Wave home automation ecosystem.

Each of its two channels features an integrated consumption measurement device. The Universal Double Switch also boasts the lowest energy consumption on the market.

At the same time, it is completely configurable so that it can adapt to the most varied needs while also being ready to be used without needing additional configurations in order to operate.

Thanks to the framework developed by WiDom, the various types of “events” on the “External Switch” can be recognised and associated to actions to be performed on the device, on any associated devices, on all devices on the network. The events that the system recognises are the number of “clicks” or hold on the External Switch.

  
External switch: External button or switch connected to the input I1 or I2

Events: The actions performed on the external Switch: Clicks or Hold.

Click: If the external switch is a button (when pressed it autonomously returns to the initial position), a click means pressing and then releasing it. If the external switch is bistable (when pressed it does not return to the initial position), a single click means one single flip of the switch.

### Inclusion Information

The device supports both the Network Wide Inclusion (which offers the opportunity of inclusion into a network even if the device is not directly connected to the controller) and the Normal Inclusion mechanisms.

If the device is not included into a Z-Wave network, a single click on the (B) button or on one of the external switches will launch the process of traditional inclusion. If the device inclusion procedure does not start within 2 seconds, the Network Wide Inclusion network will be launched lasting a variable amount of time between 15-30 seconds.

INFO: Through the inclusion procedure, activated with a single click on one of the external switches, the system determines the type of external switch (see parameter No. 62).

### Exclusion Information

Only a controller can remove a device from the network. WiDom Universal Double Switch is compatible with all Z-Wave certified controllers. After the exclusion procedure has been activated by the controller, the device can be removed, putting it in Exclusion Mode by three consecutive clicks on the (B) button or on the external switch, when available.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The WDS supports 5 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Devices to receive notifications on: status changes; instantaneous power level; device local reset 

Association group 1 supports 8 nodes.

### Group 2: On/Off control (Switch 1)

Devices controlled by switch 1

Association group 2 supports 8 nodes.

### Group 3: Dimming control (Switch 1)

Devices controlled by switch 1

Association group 3 supports 8 nodes.

### Group 4: On/Off control (Switch 2)

Devices controlled by switch 2

Association group 4 supports 8 nodes.

### Group 5: Dimming control (Switch 2)

Devices controlled by switch 2

Association group 5 supports 8 nodes.
