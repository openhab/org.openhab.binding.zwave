The WiDom Universal Relay Switch supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

WiDOM Universal Relay Switch is an ON\\OFF device based on latching relay and can be used as both a local and remote switch.

### Inclusion Information

By default, if the device is not included in any network, as soon as it is powered the Network Wide Inclusion procedure starts and lasts for about 1 minute. The procedure can be reactivated at the next device restart or by **pressing the (R) button**.

The device may be included in the network through Normal Inclusion by **pressing the (B) button once or three times or alternatively by pressing the external switch once.** 

INFO:

During the inclusion procedure activated by a single click on the external switch, the system also automatically determines the switch type (See parameter No. 62)

### Exclusion Information

After the exclusion function has been activated from the controller, the device can be removed, putting it in _Learning Mode_ by

**pressing the (B) button once or three times**

or more conveniently by

**using the external switch** after having enabled the learning mode activation from external switch (see parameter N°65).

### General Usage Information

With WiDom devices, the normal switches/buttons found in a traditional electrical system can become intelligent control systems. WiDom Framework recognises the number of clicks or hold event on the external switch and can be configured to perform different actions based on the identified event.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The WiDom Universal Relay Switch supports 5 association groups.

### Group 1: Group 1

Devices that will be notified of changes in its status

Association group 1 supports 16 nodes.

### Group 2: Group 2

Devices that will be controlled by a single click on the external switch

Association group 2 supports 16 nodes.

### Group 3: Group 3

Devices that will be controlled by a double click on the external switch

Association group 3 supports 16 nodes.

### Group 4: Group 4

Devices that will be controlled by a triple click on the external switch

Association group 4 supports 16 nodes.

### Group 5: Group 5

Devices that will be controlled by hold on the external switch

Association group 5 supports 16 nodes.
