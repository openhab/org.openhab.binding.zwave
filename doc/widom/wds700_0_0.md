The WDS700 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

WiDom Smart Double Switch 7 is an ON/OFF control device designed to independently control two separate loads, suited for being controlled by both remote and local switches. Similarly to the other WiDom “in wall” devices, it can be fully integrated into pre-existing systems and configured to associate configurable behaviors to a specific number of clicks, in full integration with the Z-Wave home automation ecosystem.

There are two versions of WiDom Double Switch:

L version - controlled by Line signal;

N version - controlled by Neutral signal.

Each of its two channels features an integrated consumption measurement device. The Smart Double Switch 7 also boasts the **lowest energy consumption on the market**.

At the same time, it is completely configurable so that it can adapt to the most varied needs while also being ready to be used without needing additional configurations in order to operate.

WiDom Smart Double Switch 7 is very easy to install and works with both momentary and toggle switch.

The device is equipped with contact protection technology (_Zero Crossing_) which reduces the electrical stress on the relay contacts and ensures a longer life. The open / closed switching of the device always occur when the instantaneous value of voltage is 0.

It operates in any Z-Wave network with other Z-Wave/Z-Wave Plus certified devices and controllers from any other manufacturer. As a constantly powered node, WiDom Smart Double Switch 7 will act as repeater regardless of the vendor in order to increase the reliability of the network.

### Inclusion Information

All WiDom Serie 700 Smart Modules are compatible with all Z-Wave/Z-Wave Plus certified controllers. The devices support both the _Network Wide Inclusion_ mechanism (which offers the ability to be included in a network, even if the device is not directly connected to the controller) and _Normal Inclusion_.

By default, the inclusion procedure starts in _Normal Inclusion_ mode and after a short timeout the procedure continues in _Network Wide Inclusion_ mode that lasts for about 20 Seconds.

Before including the device, the LED status indicator is solid RED. The procedure of inclusion is activated by clicking **Add** in the inclusion interface and by pressing any sequence of click on the integrated button. As soon as the inclusion procedure initiates the LED indicator starts a sequence of GREEN-BLUE blinks. The device is included in the network when the LED status is OFF and the interview is completed.

### Exclusion Information

Only a controller can remove the device from the network. After activating the exclusion function by the controller, the device can be removed by setting it in Learning Mode.

If you are using the WiDom Multi Sensor Room Controller, the procedure of exclusion can be activated by **Removing** a node from the Z-Wave network and any click sequence on the integrated button; as soon as the exclusion initiates, the LED indicator starts a sequence of RED-BLUE blinks. The device is excluded from the network when the LED status indicator is solid RED and the App_status in the interface is OK.

### General Usage Information

For the operation of the device within the Z-Wave network and controlling the loads connected to the device, control actions are performed on the switches.

The **CONTROL ACTIONS** are **EVENTS** executed on **EXTERNAL SWITCHES** connected to the Line Signal terminal of the device which can be _Clicks_, _Hold Down_ and _Up_.

Event: **Click**, type of switch: _momentary switch (button)_, actions on the switch: _press briefly and release (when pressed it autonomously returns to the initial position)_

Event: **Click**, type of switch: _toggle switch (bistable)_, actions on the switch: _press and release (single click means one single flip of the switch)_

Event: **MultiClick = n clicks**, type of switch: _momentary switch or toggle switch_, actions on the switch: _sequence of consecutive n clicks_

Event: **Hold Down**, type of switch: _momentary switch_, actions on the switch: _press longer than click (after a Hold Down always follows an Up event)_

Event: **Up**, type of switch: _momentary switch_, actions on the switch: _release (the event applies only if there has been a previous Hold Down event)_

Since the device supports Central Scene Notification all the events described in the table will be notified with a Central Scene Notification Report to the lifeline. The events that trigger a Central Scene Notification Report can be customized with the configuration parameter in the Central Scene Notification Parmenter section._

If more than one event must be supported, the value for the configuration parameter is the sum of the event values. For example:

1 click and 2 clicks → Parameter value must be 1 + 2 = 3

1 click and 3 clicks → Parameter value must be 1 + 4 = 5

**Default value: 2 clicks → 2**This is an advanced parameter and will therefore not show in the user interface without entering advanced mode.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The WDS700 supports 7 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Life Line Group

Association group 1 supports 8 nodes.

### Group 2: Follow CH1 state

The state of output 1 (ON/OFF) will be propagated to the associated device


Association group 2 supports 8 nodes.

### Group 3: Clicks on button 1 G1

The associated device will be controlled based on the click events and output propagation defined by configuration parameters 40-47


Association group 3 supports 8 nodes.

### Group 4: Clicks on button 1 G2

The associated device will be controlled based on the click events and output propagation defined by configuration parameters 40-47


Association group 4 supports 8 nodes.

### Group 5: Follow CH2 state

The state of output 2 (ON/OFF) will be propagated to the associated device


Association group 5 supports 8 nodes.

### Group 6: Clicks on button 2 G1

The associated device will be controlled based on the click events and output propagation defined by configuration parameters 40-47


Association group 6 supports 8 nodes.

### Group 7: Clicks on button 2 G2

The associated device will be controlled based on the click events and output propagation defined by configuration parameters 40-47
