The DRY supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

WiDom Smart Dry Contact Switch can turn ON and OFF equipments with an independent power supply, such as solenoid valves (e.g. gas, water and irrigation), power operated valves etc. 

WiDom Smart Dry Contact Switch is very easy to install and works with both momentary and toggle switches. 

The device is equipped with contact protection technology (Zero Crossing) which reduces the electrical stress on the relay contacts and ensures a longer life. The open / closed switching of the device always occur when the instantaneous value of voltage is 0. 

It operates in any Z-Wave network with other Z-Wave/Z-Wave Plus certified devices and controllers from any other manufacturer. As a constantly powered node, WiDom Smart Double Switch will act as repeater regardless of the vendor in order to increase the reliability of the network.

### Inclusion Information

WiDom Smart Dry Contact Switch is compatible with all Z-Wave/Z-Wave Plus certified controllers. The device supports both the Network Wide Inclusion mechanism (which offers the ability to be included in a network, even if the device is not directly connected to the controller) and Normal Inclusion. By default, the inclusion procedure starts in Normal Inclusion mode and after a short time out the procedure continues in Network Wide Inclusion mode that lasts for about 20 Seconds.

Before including the device the LED status indicator is solid RED. The procedure of inclusion is activated by clicking Add in the inclusion interface and by pressing any sequence of click on the integrated button. As soon as the inclusion procedure initiates the LED indicator starts a sequence of GREEN-BLUE blinks. The device is included in the network when the LED status is OFF and the interview is completed. 

### Exclusion Information

Only a controller can remove the device from the network. After activating the exclusion function by the controller, the device can be removed by setting it in Learning Mode. As soon as the exclusion initiates, the LED indicator starts a sequence of RED-BLUE blinks. The device is excluded from the network when the LED status indicator is solid RED and the App_status in the interface is OK.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The DRY supports 4 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 8 nodes.

### Group 2: 1 Click


Association group 2 supports 8 nodes.

### Group 3: 2 Clicks


Association group 3 supports 8 nodes.

### Group 4: 3 Clicks


Association group 4 supports 8 nodes.
