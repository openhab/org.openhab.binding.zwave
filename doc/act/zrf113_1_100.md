The ZRF113 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

The ZRF113 Isolated Contact Fixture Module is a component of the HomePro lighting control system. Wire the Isolated Contact Fixture Module according to the diagram above and program it from the Wireless Controller to operate loads.  Inclusion of this Switch on the ZTH100 Wireless Controller menu allows remote ON/OFF control of load connected.

This Isolated Contact Fixture Module is designed to work with other Z-Wave enabled devices. Z-Wave nodes of other types can be included on the network and will also act as repeaters if they support this function.  

As part of a Z-Wave network, the ZRF113 will also act as a wireless repeater to insure that commands intended for another device in the network are received. This is useful when the device would otherwise be out of the radio range of the wireless controller.

There are no field repairable assemblies on this unit.. If service is needed, the unit must be returned where purchased.

DANGER! SHOCK HAZARD. Read and understand these instructions before installing. This device is intended for installation in accordance with the National Electric code and local regulations in the United States, or the Canadian Electrical Code and local regulations in Canada. It is recommended that a qualified electrician perform this installation.

**INSTALLATION**

Wire this module in series with a 20 amp (maximum) load according to the diagram above. If AS101’s are used they must be wired to the same line (or neutral) also wired to the master unit as well as the load being controlled, and not wired to any other neutral. If multiple neutral wires are tied together in one box, separate the neutral wires to preserve the integrity of the ZRF113 circuit. Caution! Do not wire unit “live” (with power on the circuit) and do notallow the yellow wire to contact line voltage, neutral or ground or you will damage the device. See the ZTH100 Wireless Controller operating instructions to include this module under the command of the Wireless Controller.

**NOTE **

If you have trouble adding the ZRF113 to a group it may be that the Home ID and Node ID were not cleared from it after testing. You must first “RESET UNIT” with your controller to remove it from the network. If using the ZTH100 select “SETUP” and scroll to “RESET UNIT” 

Although adding it to a group includes it in the network, removing it from a group does not remove it from the network. If removed from a group, it functions only as a repeater.

With the Wireless Controller, the ZRF113 can be switched ON and OFF remotely, and can be included (or excluded) in groups of lights that operate at the same time (a group can also be a single module), and in scenes that set a lighting mood.

Note that the Associations, and possibly other features, vary depending on the release.  The original version 1 units used 4 associations.  This release, release 1.1, uses 2.

## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 2 configuration parameters available in the ZRF113.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Configuration Parameter 1 | Set Ignore Start Level Bit When Transmitting Dim Command |
| 19 | Configuration Parameter 19 | LED Transmission Indication |
|  | Switch All Mode | Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands |

### Parameter 1: Configuration Parameter 1

Set Ignore Start Level Bit When Transmitting Dim Command
The ZRF113 can send Dim commands to Z-Wave enabled dimmers. The Dim command has a start level embedded in it. A dimmer receiving this command will start dimming from that start level. However, the command also has a bit that indicates whether the dimmer should ignore the start level. If the bit is set to 1, the dimmer will ignore the start level and instead start dimming from its current level. To clear this bit, configure this parameter to the value of 0.

NOTE: Each Configuration Parameter can be set to its default by setting the default bit in the Configuration Set command. See your controller’s instructions on how to do this (and if it supports it). All Configuration commands will be reset to their default state when the ZRF113 is excluded from the Z-Wave network by using the controller to reset the node (on the ZTH100 select “SETUP” and scroll to “RESET UNIT”).This is an advanced parameter and will therefore not show in the user interface without entering advanced mode.
The following option values may be configured, in addition to values in the range 0 to 1 -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Don't Ignore Dimmer Command Start Level Bit |
| 1 | Ignore Dimmer Command Start Level Bit (Default) |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (Ignore Dimmer Command Start Level Bit (Default)).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 19: Configuration Parameter 19

LED Transmission Indication
The ZRF113 will flicker its LED when it is transmitting to any of its groups. This flickering can be set to not flicker at all (set to 0), to flicker the entire time it is transmitting (set to 1), or to flicker for only 1 second when it begins transmitting (set to 2). By default, the ZRF113 is set to flicker for only 1 second.

NOTE: Each Configuration Parameter can be set to its default by setting the default bit in the Configuration Set command. See your controller’s instructions on how to do this (and if it supports it). All Configuration commands will be reset to their default state when the ZRF113 is excluded from the Z-Wave network by using the controller to reset the node (on the ZTH100 select “SETUP” and scroll to “RESET UNIT”).This is an advanced parameter and will therefore not show in the user interface without entering advanced mode.
The following option values may be configured, in addition to values in the range 0 to 2 -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | No Flicker |
| 1 | Flicker while transmitting |
| 2 | Flicker for 1 second (Default) |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```2``` (Flicker for 1 second (Default)).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_19_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Switch All Mode

Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands.

The following option values may be configured -:
| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Exclude from All On and All Off groups |
| 1 | Include in All On group |
| 2 | Include in All Off group |
| 255 | Include in All On and All Off groups |

This parameter has the configuration ID ```switchall_mode``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZRF113 supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Group 2

Auxilliary Switch 2 Tap
If you associate a Z-Wave device into Group 2, you can turn that device on and off by tapping the top or bottom of the auxiliary switch twice. You can brighten or dim devices by tapping the top or bottom of the auxiliary switch once and then holding the switch down. The load attached to the ZRF113 is not affected.

A NOTE ABOUT DIMMERS IN A GROUP: If you combine Z-Wave enabled dimmers and other types of ZWave devices in a group, place a Z-Wave enabled dimmer into the empty group first to ensure that the dimming operates correctly.

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Group 3

Auxilliary Switch 3 Tap
If you associate a Z-Wave device into Group 3, you can turn that device on and off by tapping the top or bottom of the auxiliary switch three times . You can brighten or dim devices by tapping the top or bottom of the auxiliary switch twice and then hold the top down for brighten or bottom for dim (bottom only if AS001). The load attached to the ZRF113 is not affected.

A NOTE ABOUT DIMMERS IN A GROUP: If you combine Z-Wave enabled dimmers and other types of ZWave devices in a group, place a Z-Wave enabled dimmer into the empty group first to ensure that the dimming operates correctly.

Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.
