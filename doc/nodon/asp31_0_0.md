The ASP-3-1 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

# "Learning Mode"

Press on the Smart Plug button during 2 seconds until the LED becomes red. Release the button, the LED will then glow in red. The Smart Plug is in “Learning mode”. To add or to remove the Smart Plug from a Z-Wave® network, follow “INCLUSION” or “EXCLUSION” procedures below.

If the Smart Plug is not added or removed from a network within 30 seconds (or if the button is pushed during learning mode), the Smart Plug will automatically exit learning mode.

# “Factory Reset”

To perform a factory reset, press on the Smart Plug button during 5 seconds until the LED becomes orange. Release the button, the LED will blink red/green. Factory Reset clears the Smart Plug’s memory and set parameters to default value.

Please use this procedure only when the primary controller is missing or otherwise inoperable. Resetting the Smart Plug does not mean it has been removed from Z-Wave network controller’s memory. Use the primary controller to remove the Smart Plug from its Z-Wave network (follow “EXCLUSION” procedures below), before doing a Factory Reset.

### Inclusion Information

To add the Smart Plug into a Z-Wave network:

  1. Plug the Smart Plug.
  2. Put the Smart Plug in “Learning mode”.
  3. Within 30 seconds put the Z-Wave Controller in “Learning mode” (See the Controller user guide for its own Inclusion procedure).
  4. The Smart Plug will confirm the Inclusion procedure by blinking its LED in Green.

### Exclusion Information

To remove the Smart Plug from a Z-Wave network:

  1. Make sure the Smart Plug is plugged.
  2. Put the Smart Plug in “Learning mode”.
  3. Within 30 seconds put the Z-Wave Controller in “Learning mode” (See the Controller user guide for its own Exclusion procedure).
  4. The Smart Plug will confirm the Exclusion procedure by blinking its LED in Red.

## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 4 configuration parameters available in the ASP-3-1.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Default State | Default State |
| 2 | Power Failure | Power Failure |
| 3 | Follow State |  |
| 4 | Always On |  |
|  | Switch All Mode | Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands |

### Parameter 1: Default State

Default State
Status of the Smart Plug after a Power Failure or after being plugged
The following option values may be configured, in addition to values in the range 0 to 63 -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Off |
| 1 | On |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```2``` (Status before Power Failure).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Power Failure

Power Failure
This parameter is to set-up the Power Failure / Recover notification and the associated group (Groups 4, 5, 6, 7, 8).

The value may be a sum of available values. For example, if you want to activate Power Failure and enable group 4 & 5, the parameter value should be 1+2+4=7.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ASP-3-1 supports 8 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
This group is generally used to report information of the Smart Plug to the Main Controller of the network.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Follow State

When the Smart Plug is switched ON (respectively OFF) using the local button, it will send ON (respectively OFF) command to the associated devices. No command is sent if the Smart Plug is switched ON or OFF wirelessly.

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Follow Complementary State

When the Smart Plug is switched ON (respectively OFF) using the local button, it will send OFF (respectively ON) command to the associated devices. No command is sent if the Smart Plug is switched ON or OFF wirelessly.

Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 4: Power Failure Notification

When the Smart Plug detects a power failure or recovers from a power failure, it sends the notification report to the associated devices.

The notification sent is “Notification Report: Power Management – AC Disconnected / Re-connected”.

Association group 4 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 5: Power Failure Set ON

When the Smart Plug detects a Power Failure, it will switch ON the associated devices.

Association group 5 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 6: Power Failure Set OFF

When the Smart Plug detects a Power Failure, it will switch OFF the associated devices.

Association group 6 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 7: Power Recover Set ON

When the Smart Plug detects a Power Recover, it will switch ON the associated devices.

Association group 7 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 8: Power Recover Set OFF

When the Smart Plug detects a Power Recover, it will switch OFF the associated devices.

Association group 8 supports 5 nodes.
