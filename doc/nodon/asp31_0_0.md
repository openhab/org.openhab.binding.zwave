The ASP-3-1 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

<h1&gt"Learning Mode"</h1&gt <p&gtPress on the Smart Plug button during 2 seconds until the LED becomes red. Release the button, the LED will then glow in red. The Smart Plug is in “Learning mode”. To add or to remove the Smart Plug from a Z-Wave® network, follow “INCLUSION” or “EXCLUSION” procedures below.</p&gt <p&gtIf the Smart Plug is not added or removed from a network within 30 seconds (or if the button is pushed during learning mode), the Smart Plug will automatically exit learning mode.</p&gt <h1&gt“Factory Reset”</h1&gt <p&gtTo perform a factory reset, press on the Smart Plug button during 5 seconds until the LED becomes orange. Release the button, the LED will blink red/green. Factory Reset clears the Smart Plug’s memory and set parameters to default value.</p&gt <p&gtPlease use this procedure only when the primary controller is missing or otherwise inoperable. Resetting the Smart Plug does not mean it has been removed from Z-Wave network controller’s memory. Use the primary controller to remove the Smart Plug from its Z-Wave network (follow “EXCLUSION” procedures below), before doing a Factory Reset.</p&gt

### Inclusion Information

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ASP-3-1 supports 8 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
<p&gtThis group is generally used to report information of the Smart Plug to the Main Controller of the network.</p&gt

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Follow State

<p&gtWhen the Smart Plug is switched ON (respectively OFF) using the local button, it will send ON (respectively OFF) command to the associated devices. No command is sent if the Smart Plug is switched ON or OFF wirelessly.</p&gt

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Follow Complementary State

<p&gtWhen the Smart Plug is switched ON (respectively OFF) using the local button, it will send OFF (respectively ON) command to the associated devices. No command is sent if the Smart Plug is switched ON or OFF wirelessly.</p&gt

Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 4: Power Failure Notification

<p&gtWhen the Smart Plug detects a power failure or recovers from a power failure, it sends the notification report to the associated devices.</p&gt <p&gtThe notification sent is “Notification Report: Power Management – AC Disconnected / Re-connected”.</p&gt

Association group 4 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 5: Power Failure Set ON

<p&gtWhen the Smart Plug detects a Power Failure, it will switch ON the associated devices.</p&gt

Association group 5 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 6: Power Failure Set OFF

<p&gtWhen the Smart Plug detects a Power Failure, it will switch OFF the associated devices.</p&gt

Association group 6 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 7: Power Recover Set ON

<p&gtWhen the Smart Plug detects a Power Recover, it will switch ON the associated devices.</p&gt

Association group 7 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 8: Power Recover Set OFF

<p&gtWhen the Smart Plug detects a Power Recover, it will switch OFF the associated devices.</p&gt

Association group 8 supports 5 nodes.
