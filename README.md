# ZWave Binding
The ZWave binding supports an interface to a wireless Z-Wave home automation network. 

ZWave is a wireless home automation protocol with reliable two way communications between nodes. It supports a mesh network where mains powered nodes can route messages between nodes that could otherwise not communicate with each other. The network supports hop distances of up to four hops.

A wide range of devices are supported from lights, switches and sensors to smoke alarms, window coverings and keyfobs. Z-Wave certification guarantees that certified devices will be compatible with each other and the network.


## Supported Things

### ZWave Serial Adapter

Before the binding can be used, a serial adapter must be added. This needs to be done manually. Select `Serial ZStick`, and enter the serial port.


## Discovery

Once the binding is authorized, and an adapter is added, it automatically reads all devices that are set up on the Z-Wave controller and puts them in the Inbox.


## Binding Configuration

There is no binding level configuration required for the Z-Wave binding. All configuration is performed on the devices, or the controller. This allows the system to support multiple controllers.


### Controller Configuration

#### Serial Port

Sets the serial port name for the controller.


#### Controller Is Master

When *Controller Is Master* is true, the binding expects to be the main Z-Wave controller in the system. This is not related to the type of controller (*Primary* or *Secondary*), but is related to how devices will be configured.  This will instruct the binding to perform configuration of the device to send network related information such as device wakeup to the binding.

Many functions in Z-Wave only allow a single node to be set, and this is normally reserved for the main system controller. For example, battery device *Wakeup Node*, and *Lifeline* association groups usually only allow a single device to be set.

For most systems, this should be set to *true* - the only time when it should be *false* is if you normally control your Z-Wave network through a different system.


#### Controller Is SUC

#### Heal Time


#### Inclusion Mode


#### Secure Inclusion Mode

The secure command classes allow you to secure communications between devices in your network. Secure communications is a good thing, and for devices such as locks that protect the security of your property, it's mandatory. However, most devices support the same communications and functions over the standard communication classes, without security. The secure classes come with some negative points - they communicate more slowly, and consume more power in battery devices. This is because there is roughly twice as much communication required for the security classes. You should therefore consider if you need all devices secured, or if it is acceptable for your system to only secure entry devices.

This option allows you to select which classes will be configured to use security - you can elect to use security on all devices that support it, or only on entry control devices.


#### Inclusion Mode Timeout

This sets the maximum time that the controller will remain in inclusion or exclusion mode. Once inclusion is enabled, it will be disabled either when the first device is discovered, or when the timeout occurs. Generally this should be kept to a minimum as it increases the opportunity for unwanted nodes to be included into the network.

Note that updating this value will cause the controller to be reinitialised which will take all your Z-Wave devices offline for a short period.


#### Network Security Key

This sets the network security key used in your network for securing communications using the secure command classes. It is a 16 byte value, specified in hexadecimal.

### Device Channels


## Initialisation

To initialise the bunding and get your Z-Wave network running, you need to follow the following steps -:

* Manually install the serial controller. It doesn't matter what type of Z-Wave dongle you have, there is only a single *thing type* since all sticks use the same communication protocol, and the binding can detect what functions the device supports by communicating with the stick.
* Set the serial port in the controller configuration.
* In the UI enable *discovery* mode - this will add all existing things into the *discovery inbox*. From the *inbix* you can add the device directly into the system.
* the binding should automatically detect the device type and should provide a list of *channels* to which you can attach *items*. Note that it may take some time to discover the device type - especially in battery devices.


## Z-Wave Network

This section provides information on the Z-Wave network, and how functions are implemented in the binding.

### Network Overview

The Z-Wave network includes devices known as *Controllers* and *Slaves*. As the name suggests, *Controllers* control how the network runs and provide network administration functions, while *Slaves* are users of the network.

#### Home ID
The network is identified with a *Home ID*. This is programmed into the controller, and can't be changed. It is used to identify the network in all frames that are transmitted over the air. When a device is included into a network, the controller sets the *Home ID* of the network in the slave so that the slave will only communicate over this network until it is removed from the network.


#### Node ID
Each node in the network is identified with a *Node ID*. The controller allocated the *Node ID* when the device is included into the network. A single Z-Wave network supports 232 devices (*Node ID* 1 to 232). The controller will allocate node IDs sequentially. Normally therefore the controller has Node ID 1 since it is normally the first device in the network. IDs will then be allocated sequentially up to number 232 after which the controller will allocate unused addresses.


#### Message Routing

A Z-Wave network is a *Mesh Network*. This allows each device in the network to route frames within the network so that devices don't need to communicate directly with the controller.  The Z-Wave network allows up to 4 hops.  For a network to work efficiently, each device must be able to communicate with a number of other devices - this creates what is known as a "Strong Mesh". It provides the controller with multiple options when selecting routes, and makes the network tolerant of device failures or radio interference issues.

If a route doesn't work, the controller will try a different route - up to three routes will be tried and if the message is not delivered the controller will report the failure.

Frames can also be transmitted as *Broadcast Frames* within the Z-Wave network, however to avoid overloading the network, *Broadcast Frames* are not routed so can only be used within direct communication of the sending device.


#### Command Classes

Z-Wave uses what are known as *Command Classes* to communicate. These *Command Classes* are a set of standardised commands to allow devices to perform specific functions. Each *Command Class* has a specific function, and each device will likely support multiple classes to allow the users to interact with the device.

Every device supports the *BASIC* command class. This is normally mapped to a specific *Command Class* - the *BASIC* class is used to provide a high degree of interoperability between devices, and is especially useful when devices are communicating peer-to-peer as slaves do not need to know the detail of many different classes.


### Controllers

There are different types of controllers.

#### Primary Controller
There is a single *Primary* controller in the network. This controller provides the network routing table


#### Static Update Controller (SUC)


#### Static ID Server (SIS)


### Slaves

Most devices in your network are *slaves* - they come in in two types, *routing* and *non-routing*.


## Z-Wave in practice

### Inclusion and Exclusion

Inclusion and exclusion are always started by the primary controller, unless an *SIS* is available in the network, in which case any controller can start these functions.  To include or exclude a device in the network, set the controller into include mode, and press the appropriate button on the device to place the device into include mode.  All Z-Wave devices will have such a button, and you should refer to the device manual.

Secure inclusion must be started from the binding. This is because once the device is included into the network, a key exchange takes place between the binding and the device. This key exchange must take place within a very short time of the inclusion, and if it doesn't succeed, the device must be excluded and included again.  Secure inclusion will generate a lot of activity on the network, so you should avoid other activities at the same time, and the device being included should be close to the controller to reduce any retries that could cause the security handshake to fail.


### Associations

Associations are used by Z-Wave devices to send commands from one device to another, independent of the controller. This could be used to turn on a light when a movement sensor is triggered. Associations are also used to send state updates to the controller when the state of a device changes. For example, if you turn a light on, the device will let the controller know so that the state of the light is shown correctly within the user interface.

Often there is a *Lifeline* association group, and normally this is the only association that is required in order to notify the binding of changes to the device. If you set the controller node into other association groups, you will likely receive multiple notifications - while this shouldn't cause problems most of the time, it can reduce battery life in battery powered devices, and may cause issues with rules.


### Battery Devices

Z-Wave battery devices require additional configuration in order for them to operate properly. In Z-Wave, most battery devices spend the majority of the time sleeping, and they only wake up very occasionally to allow commands to be sent to them. The binding therefore queues any messages to battery devices until they wake up - this can be every 10 minutes or so, or it could be once per day! All battery devices will have a a button, or some other way to wake the device up, and this can be useful while configuring the devices.

In order to configure the device properly following its initial inclusion in the network, the device must be woken up a number of times while close to the controller. During this time, the binding will read the device information, but will also configure some settings. The most important is to configure the wakeup period, and wakeup node - until this is done, the device will not wake up periodically, and if it is out of direct range of the controller, it will not be able to communicate with the controller.


### Polling

The binding supports periodic polling. This has two purposes - firstly to ensure that a device is still responding, and secondly to update the bindings representation of the state of the device.  Where possible *associations* should be used to update the device state - this will keep network traffic to a minimum, which will improve the network latency, and it will be faster since *associations* send updates to the controller immediately where polling will always be noticeably slower.

Keep the polling at a slow rate unless your device doesn't support *associations*.


### Binding Maintenance Functions

#### Mesh Heal

Sometimes the Z-Wave mesh can get messed up and nodes can become 'lost'. In theory, the Z-Wave controller should automatically resolve these issues, and any device that finds itself orphaned from the network should send a *Explorer Frames* to request a routing update.

In order to manually repair the mesh, the binding implements a *mesh heal* function. This will systematically work through the network nodes, starting with the controller and working outwards. For each node, the controller will request an update to the nodes neighbors - this can take up to a minute to complete foe each node, although it is normally much less. The neighbor update will only be performed on nodes that are *listening* - this means battery devices will not be updated through this process but they should be updated by the controller.

While the neighbor update is running, all nodes in the system will be taken offline to avoid network traffic that may adversely impact the update.

Once the neighbor update is complete, the system will perform a routing update on all nodes. Z-Wave is a "source routed mesh network" which means that the controller needs to tell the end nodes information about its routes. Specifically, the controller will provide each node a list of routes required to talk to the controller, the SUC (if it exists in the network), and other nodes to which the controller needs to talk to (eg for associated devices). The binding simply instructs the stick to configure a route between two nodes - the route itself if derived by the stick and the binding has no visibility of the actual routes being used.


### Z-Wave Device Database

A database of device information is required for Z-Wave since there is no way to know the devices configuration directly from the device. Some Z-Wave command classes have preset configuration, and these we can implicitly configure, however the configuration command class has no device specific declarations. This data is normally provided by the device manufacturer in the manual, or on their website.

The binding makes use of the database to derive device names, and provide a list of channels that are available on the device. If there is no database entry, then (currently) the device will show up as *Unknown* in the things list.

Devices are identified in the database by 4 pieces of information that are provided by the device during the initial discovery process. These are -:

* Manufacturer ID
* Device Type
* Device ID
* Firmware version

The primary identification is performed using the Manufacturer ID, Device Type and Device ID. Many devices use multiple deviceType and deviceId sets to identify different regions, or other minor differences, and some manufacturers will produce multiple firmware versions for the same device, so this information is also used in some instances.


#### Unknown Devices 

If the device is listed as *Unknown*, then the device has not been fully discovered by the binding and will not work correctly. There are a few possible reasons for this -:

* **The device is not in the database.** If the device attributes show that this device has a valid manufacturer ID, device ID and type, then this is likely the case (eg. you see a label like "*Z-Wave node 1 (0082:6015:020D::2.0)*"). Even if the device appears to be in the database, some manufacturers use multiple sets of references for different regions or versions, and your device references may not be in the database. In either case, the database must be updated and you should raise an issue to get this addressed.
* **The device initialisation is not complete.** Once the device is included into the network, the binding must interrogate it to find out what type of device it is. One part of this process is to get the manufacturer information required to identify the device, and until this is done, the device will remain unknown. For mains powered devices, this will occur quickly, however for battery devices the device must be woken up a number of  times to allow the discovery phase to complete. This must be performed with the device close to the controller.
