All Z-Wave devices must be "Included" on the Controller (Hub) before it can be controlled from a smart device. The Hub should be brought physically closer to the device just for the "Inclusion" process (recommended within 10ft). When finished, the Hub and device can be moved back to final installation location. Download the App or log onto the website associated with the Hub you are using and follow their Inclusion/ Exclusion instructions as each Hub's programming and features are different.</p> <p>• During the Inclusion/ Exclusion process, the Program Button on the relay or the ON/OFF toggle on the switch can be used for including/ excluding the device.</p> <p>o When using the ON/OFF toggle, the toggle must be toggled ON and OFF 3 times.</p> <p>• It is best to perform an Exclusion of the device prior to performing an Inclusion.</p> <p>Step 1. From the Control Panel, go the the device Exclusion page.</p> <p>o Select "Exclude Device".</p> <p>o When prompted, press the Program Button on the Relay once or the ON/OFF toggle on the switch 3 times.</p> <p>Step 2. Go to the "Add Device" page.</p> <p>o Select "Include Device".</p> <p>o When prompted, press the Program Button on the Relay once or the ON/OFF toggle on the switch 3 times.</p> <p>The primary controller should indicate that the action was successful. If the controller indicates the action was unsuccessful, please repeat from Step 1. Once the relay is part of the network, the same basic procedure is used to add</p> <p>the relay to groups &amp; scenes or change advanced functions. Refer to the Hub’s instructions for details. Step 3. Follow the On-Screen instructions in the Control Panel on adding or removing rooms, scenes, other devices, and other functions and features.</p>

Unsolicited Report Configuration<br /><h1>Overview</h1><p>ZWN-RSM1-PLUS can send unsolicited status reports to the primary controller (Node ID 0x1) when the switch is toggled if the controller is designed as a gateway. If your controller is not a gateway or does not need the status reported or you think it could confuse your Z-Wave network, you can use Command_Class_Configuration to disable this function. By default this function is disabled.</p>
