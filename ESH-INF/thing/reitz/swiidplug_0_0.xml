SwiidPlug<br /><h1>Overview</h1><p>The SwiidPlug™ is designed to switch on and off remotely appliances (mainly lights) which are plugged into its female socket, The SwiidPlug™ is suitable for the wireless switching of incandescent light bulbs as well as halogen and LED lights (all transformer types). The SwiidPlug™ can be operated manually by pressing on its FUNCTION button which then acts as an on/off toggle switch and can be operated remotely and wirelessly by Z -Wave®. The SwiidPlug™ can also handle associations with other devices, both ways to and from it. Thus, your SwiidPlug™ can respond directly to a signal from another Z-Wave® device in your network, such as the triggering of a presence detector. As soon as it has been plugged into a mains socket, the SwiidPlug™ can be included into a Z-Wave® network so as to interoperate with controllers and other Z-Wave® devices. </p> <p>http://www.swiid.com/medias/documents/ZAP-User-s-manual-vBAT-30.11.2014.pdf</p> <p>http://www.swiid.com/medias/documents/advanced-swiidplug.pdf </p>
