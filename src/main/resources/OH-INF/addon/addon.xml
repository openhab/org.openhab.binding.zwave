	   <![CDATA[
	   The ZWave binding supports an interface to a wireless Z-Wave home automation network.
<br>
ZWave is a wireless home automation protocol with reliable two way communications between nodes. It supports a mesh network where mains powered nodes can route messages between nodes that could otherwise not communicate with each other. The network supports hop distances of up to four hops.
<br>
A wide range of devices are supported from lights, switches and sensors to smoke alarms, window coverings and keyfobs. Z-Wave certification guarantees that certified devices will be compatible with each other and the network.
<br>
The binding uses a standard Z-Wave serial stick to communicate with the Z-Wave devices. There are many sticks available, and they all support the same interface so the binding does not distinguish between them.
