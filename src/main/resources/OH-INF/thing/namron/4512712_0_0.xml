Remote control switch with one channel<br /> <h1>Overview</h1><p>Product Description</p><p>The remote control is a Z-Wave device that can both control other Z-Wave devices and activate scenes in Gateways. Although it is controlling other devices, the device cannot act as Z-Wave network controller (primary or secondary) and will always need a Z-Wave network controller to be included into a Z-Wave network. It also supports the Over The Air (OTA) feature for the product’s firmware upgrade.</p><p>The remote control has following functions:</p><ol><li>Control of groups of other Z-Wave devices using 'ON', 'OFF' and Dim commands.</li><li>Activation of scenes in Gateway mode.</li></ol><p>The encryption modes that the remote control supports are S0, S2 Authenticated, S2 Unauthenticated. When the remote control is being included into a Z-Wave network, you can use your primary controller/gateway to enable one encryption mode or disable encryption. (The primary controller/gateway shall support encryption mode configuration).</p> <br /> <h2>Inclusion Information</h2><p>Step 1. Make sure the remote control does not belong to any Z-Wave network, short press any button, if LED indicator does not turn on, the remote control does not belong to any network, then continue step 2,if LED indicator turns on, it means the remote control has already been included to a network, please first set the remote control to exclusion mode (refer to the part "Exclusion" of this manual),then continue step 2.</p><p>Step 2. Set primary controller/gateway into inclusion mode (Please refer to your primary controllers manual on how to turn your controller into inclusion).</p><p>Step 3. Press and hold down both and buttons over 3 seconds, LED indicator turns on, the remote control will be set to inclusion mode, and waiting to be included, after 10s LED indicator blinks 6 times quickly to indicate successful inclusion. The remote control is a sleepy device, after inclusion it will not enter into sleepy mode immediately, and will continue activation status for 30s and wait data interaction from the gateway, the LED indicator will stay solid on, please be patient to wait LED indicator to turn off.</p> <br /> <h2>Exclusion Information</h2><p>There are two exclusion methods:</p><p>Method 1: Exclusion from the primary controller/gateway as follows:</p><ol><li>Set the primary controller/gateway into exclusion mode (Please refer to your primary controllers manual on how to set your controller into exclusion).</li><li>Press and hold down both and buttons over 3 seconds, LED indicator turns on, the remote control will be set to exclusion mode, and waiting to be excluded, after 7s LED indicator blinks 4 times quickly to indicate successful exclusion.</li></ol><p>Method 2: Factory reset the remote control will force the remote control to be excluded from a network. (please refer to the part “Factory Reset” of this manual)</p><p>Note: Factory reset is not recommended for exclusion, please use this procedure only if the primary controller/gateway is missing or otherwise inoperable.</p><p>How to check whether the remote control already included to a network:</p><p>Short press any button, if LED indicator blinks 3 times, the remote control does not belong to any network, if LED indicator turns on, it means the remote control has already been included to a network.</p> <br /> <h2>Wakeup Information</h2><p>Press any button to wake the controller<br /></p>
