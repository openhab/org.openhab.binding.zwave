    <label>Wave Pro 3 A DIN rail mountable 3-channel smart switch with potential-free contacts</label>
    <description><![CDATA[
A DIN rail mountable 3-channel smart switch with potential-free contacts<br /> <h1>Overview</h1><p>The Device is a DIN rail mountable 3-channel smart switch with potential-free contacts. It controls the on/off function for three independent electrical devices with a load up to 16 A per channel (48 A in total). It is compatible with switches (default) and push-buttons.</p> <br /> <h2>Inclusion Information</h2><p>SmartStart adding (inclusion)</p><p>SmartStart enabled products can be added into a Z-Wave® network by scanning the Z-Wave® QR Code present on the Device with a gateway providing SmartStart inclusion. No further action is required, and the SmartStart device will be added automatically within 10 minutes of being switched on in the network vicinity.</p><p>With the gateway application scan the QR code on the Device label and add the Security 2 (S2) Device Specific Key (DSK) to the provisioning list in the gateway.</p><p>Connect the Device to a power supply.</p><p>Check if the blue LED is blinking in Mode 1. If so, the Device is not added to a Z-Wave® network.</p><p>Adding will be initiated automatically within a few seconds after connecting the Device to a power supply, and the Device will be added to a Z-Wave® network automatically.</p><p>The blue LED will be blinking in Mode 2 during the adding process.</p><p>The green LED will be blinking in Mode 1 if the Device is successfully added to a Z-Wave® network.</p><p>Adding (inclusion) with the S button (*not available for Long Range inclusion)</p><p>Connect the Device to a power supply.</p><p>Check if the blue LED is blinking in Mode 1. If so, the Device is not added to a Z-Wave® network.</p><p>Enable add/remove mode on the gateway.</p><p>To enter the Setting mode, press and hold the S button on the Device until the LED turns solid blue.</p><p>Release and then press and hold (&gt; 2s) the S button on the Device until the blue LED starts blinking in Mode 3. Releasing the S button will start the Learn mode.</p><p>The blue LED will be blinking in Mode 2 during the adding process.</p><p>The green LED will be blinking in Mode 1 if the Device is successfully added to a Z-Wave® network.</p><p>Note! In Setting mode, the Device has a timeout of 10s before entering again into Normal mode.</p> <br /> <h2>Exclusion Information</h2><p>Removing (exclusion) with the S button</p><p>Connect the Device to a power supply.</p><p>Check if the green LED is blinking in Mode 1. If so, the Device is added to a Z-Wave® network.</p><p>Enable add/remove mode on the gateway.</p><p>To enter the Setting mode, press and hold the S button on the Device until the LED turns solid blue.</p><p>Release and then press and hold (&gt; 2s) the S button on the Device until the blue LED starts blinking in Mode 3. Releasing the S button will start the Learn mode.</p><p>The blue LED will be blinking in Mode 2 during the removing process.</p><p>The blue LED will be blinking in Mode 1 if the Device is successfully removed from a Z-Wave® network.</p><p>Note! In Setting mode, the Device has a timeout of 10s before entering again into Normal mode.</p><p>Removing (exclusion) with a switch/push-button</p><p>Connect the Device to a power supply.</p><p>Check if the green LED is blinking in Mode 1. If so, the Device is added to a Z-Wave® network.</p><p>Enable add/remove mode on the gateway.</p><p>Toggle the switch/push-button connected to any of the SW terminals (SW, SW1, SW2,…) 3 times within 3 seconds (this procedure puts the Device in Learn mode). The Device must receive on/off signal 3 times, which means pressing the momentary switch 3 times, or toggling the switch on and off 3 times.</p><p>The blue LED will be blinking in Mode 2 during the removing process.</p><p>The blue LED will be blinking in Mode 1 if the Device is successfully removed from a Z-Wave® network.</p> <br /> <h2>Wakeup Information</h2><p><br /></p>
