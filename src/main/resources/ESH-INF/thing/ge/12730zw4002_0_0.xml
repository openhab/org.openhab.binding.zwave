    <description><![CDATA[
In-Wall Smart Fan Control<br /><h1>Overview</h1><h1>Product Features</h1> <ul><li>Includes white and light almond paddles that will match most standard wall plates (wall plate not included).</li> <li>Can be controlled in groups of multiple devices.</li> <li>Easily locate the switch in a dark room with the integrated blue LED indicator.</li> <li>Use by itself or with up to four GE add-on switches in three, four, five and six-way wiring configurations.</li> </ul><h1>Product Specifications</h1> <ul><li>Brand: GE/Jasco</li> <li>Model Number: 12730</li> <li>Z-Wave Cert Number: ZC08-14110015</li> </ul><br /><h2>Inclusion Information</h2><ol><li>Follow the instructions for your Z-wave certified controller to include a device to the Z-wave network.</li> <li>Once the controller is ready to include your device, press and release the top or bottom of the smart fan control switch (rocker) to include it in the network. Note: Your controller may need to be within 10 feet of the device to be included.</li> <li>Once your controller has confirmed that the device has been included, refresh the Z-wave network to optimize performance.</li> </ol><p>Please reference the controller/gatewayâ€™s manual for instructions. Now you have complete control to turn your fixture ON/OFF and adjust fan speed levels according to groups, scenes, schedules and interactive automation programmed by your controller. If your Z-wave certified controller features Remote Access, you can now control your fixture from your mobile devices.</p> <p>Note: To exclude and reset the device, follow the instructions provided by your Z-Wave controller</p> <br /><h2>Exclusion Information</h2><ol><li>Follow the instructions for your Z-wave certified controller to exclude a device to the Z-wave network.</li> <li>Once the controller is ready to exclude your device, press and release the top or bottom of the smart fan control switch (rocker) to exclude it in the network. Note: Your controller may need to be within 10 feet of the device to be exclude.</li> <li>Once your controller has confirmed that the device has been excluded, refresh the Z-wave network to optimize performance.</li> </ol>
