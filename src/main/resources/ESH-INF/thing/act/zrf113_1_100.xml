    <label>ZRF113 Isolated Contact Fixture Module Release 1.1</label>
    <description><![CDATA[
Isolated Contact Fixture Module Release 1.1<br /> <h1>Overview</h1><p>The ZRF113 Isolated Contact Fixture Module is a component of the HomePro lighting control system. Wire the Isolated Contact Fixture Module according to the diagram above and program it from the Wireless Controller to operate loads.  Inclusion of this Switch on the ZTH100 Wireless Controller menu allows remote ON/OFF control of load connected.</p><p>This Isolated Contact Fixture Module is designed to work with other Z-Wave enabled devices. Z-Wave nodes of other types can be included on the network and will also act as repeaters if they support this function.  </p><p>As part of a Z-Wave network, the ZRF113 will also act as a wireless repeater to insure that commands intended for another device in the network are received. This is useful when the device would otherwise be out of the radio range of the wireless controller.</p><p>There are no field repairable assemblies on this unit.. If service is needed, the unit must be returned where purchased.</p><p>DANGER! SHOCK HAZARD. Read and understand these instructions before installing. This device is intended for installation in accordance with the National Electric code and local regulations in the United States, or the Canadian Electrical Code and local regulations in Canada. It is recommended that a qualified electrician perform this installation.</p><p><b>INSTALLATION</b></p><p>Wire this module in series with a 20 amp (maximum) load according to the diagram above. If AS101’s are used they must be wired to the same line (or neutral) also wired to the master unit as well as the load being controlled, and not wired to any other neutral. If multiple neutral wires are tied together in one box, separate the neutral wires to preserve the integrity of the ZRF113 circuit. Caution! Do not wire unit “live” (with power on the circuit) and do notallow the yellow wire to contact line voltage, neutral or ground or you will damage the device. See the ZTH100 Wireless Controller operating instructions to include this module under the command of the Wireless Controller.</p><p><b>NOTE </b></p><p>If you have trouble adding the ZRF113 to a group it may be that the Home ID and Node ID were not cleared from it after testing. You must first “RESET UNIT” with your controller to remove it from the network. If using the ZTH100 select “SETUP” and scroll to “RESET UNIT” </p><p>Although adding it to a group includes it in the network, removing it from a group does not remove it from the network. If removed from a group, it functions only as a repeater.</p><p>With the Wireless Controller, the ZRF113 can be switched ON and OFF remotely, and can be included (or excluded) in groups of lights that operate at the same time (a group can also be a single module), and in scenes that set a lighting mood.</p><p>Note that the Associations, and possibly other features, vary depending on the release.  The original version 1 units used 4 associations.  This release, release 1.1, uses 2.</p><p><b>SPECIFICATIONS</b></p><p>Power: 120 VAC, 50/60 Hz</p><p>Signal (Frequency): 908.42 MHz</p><p>Maximum Load</p><p>   Isolated Contacts: 20 amps maximum General Purpose, 277 VAC, 10 FLA, 60 LRA, 250 VAC,</p><p>   Motor: 1 H.P. maximum, 120/240 VAC</p><p>   Incandescent: TV8 (Tungsten), 120 VAC, 960W maximum</p><p>Range: Up to 100 feet line of sight between the Wireless Controller and /or the closest HomePro Receiver Module</p> <br /> <h2>Inclusion Information</h2><p>STEP 1.. Prepare the Controller to include a unit to the network by adding it to a group (method of adding a node to the network). Refer to controller instructions. If using a ZTH100, push MENU button, select GROUPS, push OK button, see ADD UNIT TO GROUP displayed, push OK button.</p><p>STEP 2. The ZRF113 must be in its permanently installed location. Tap the button on the face of the ZRF113 once. Some Z-Wave products include the module on the release of the button.</p><p>STEP 3. You should see an indication on your Controller that the “DEVICE WAS INCLUDED” in the network.</p> <br /> <h2>Exclusion Information</h2><p>“RESET UNIT” with your controller to remove it from the network. If using the ZTH100 select “SETUP” and scroll to “RESET UNIT”</p><p>Although adding it to a group includes it in the network, removing it from a group does not remove it from the network. If removed from a group, it functions only as a repeater.</p> <br /> <h2>Wakeup Information</h2><p><br /></p>

Set Ignore Start Level Bit When Transmitting Dim Command<br /> <h1>Overview</h1><p>The ZRF113 can send Dim commands to Z-Wave enabled dimmers. The Dim command has a start level embedded in it. A dimmer receiving this command will start dimming from that start level. However, the command also has a bit that indicates whether the dimmer should ignore the start level. If the bit is set to 1, the dimmer will ignore the start level and instead start dimming from its current level. To clear this bit, configure this parameter to the value of 0.</p><p>NOTE: Each Configuration Parameter can be set to its default by setting the default bit in the Configuration Set command. See your controller’s instructions on how to do this (and if it supports it). All Configuration commands will be reset to their default state when the ZRF113 is excluded from the Z-Wave network by using the controller to reset the node (on the ZTH100 select “SETUP” and scroll to “RESET UNIT”).</p>

LED Transmission Indication<br /> <h1>Overview</h1><p>The ZRF113 will flicker its LED when it is transmitting to any of its groups. This flickering can be set to not flicker at all (set to 0), to flicker the entire time it is transmitting (set to 1), or to flicker for only 1 second when it begins transmitting (set to 2). By default, the ZRF113 is set to flicker for only 1 second.</p><p>NOTE: Each Configuration Parameter can be set to its default by setting the default bit in the Configuration Set command.
