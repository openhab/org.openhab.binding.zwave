    <description><![CDATA[
4 group CCT touch panel secondary controller<br /><h1>Overview</h1><p>SR-ZV9002T4-CCT-EU is a touch control Z-Wave Plus certified wall controller for dual color LED Lighting. As a z-wave secondary controller,<br /> it is a z wave light switch which can be added to z-wave network and removed from z-wave network by z-wave primary (master) controllers<br /> or gateway and control z-wave devices that are added to the network It supports 5 groups for associations, a lifeline group association to<br /> primary (master) controller and 4 groups association to devices, the group association to devices supports maximum 12 Z-wave devices per group.</p> <p>It is a universal z-wave slave which can be compatible with universal z-wave primary controller or gateway. The wireless controller is compatible with dual color z wave device SR-ZV9102FA-CCT and different frequencies are available for different countries or areas. The signal transmit distance can be up to 30m. The controller supports group and scene storage and recall functions.</p> <p>The controller is easy to install on the wall and available in standard EU size.</p> <p><strong>Key Features</strong></p> <ul><li>Z-Wave Plus certified</li> <li>Touch panel dual color Z-Wave wall controller</li> <li>Source-routed Mesh Network Architecture</li> <li>Each device works as a node</li> <li>All Nodes Are Transceivers</li> <li>Each Z-wave Network Allows Up to 232 Devices</li> <li>Actively route around and circumvent obstacles or radio dead spots</li> <li>Wireless Synchronization to Drastically Increase Control Distance</li> <li>Devices can communicate to one another by using intermediate nodes</li> <li>Added or removed by primary controllers or gateway</li> <li>Supports 1 lifeline group association to master controller</li> <li>Supports 4 groups association to z-wave devices, maximum 12 devices per group</li> <li>Compatible with universal z-wave primary controller or gateway</li> <li>Supports group, scene storage and recall functions</li> </ul><br /><h2>Inclusion Information</h2><p>Inclusion (Add the device to a Z-Wave network):</p> <ol><li>Set primary controller/gateway into inclusion mode (Please refer to your primary controllers manual on how to turn your controller into inclusion).</li> <li>Make sure the wall controller does not belong to any Z-Wave network (please refer to the part “How to check whether the wall controller included to a network” of this manual).</li> <li>Short press the “inclusion/exclusion” button, or press and hold down “ALL ON/OFF” button for over 3 seconds, the wall controller will be set to inclusion mode, and waiting to be included, then LED indicator turns on and blinks 6 times quickly to indicate successful inclusion.</li> </ol><p>Once the wall controller quits “inclusion mode”, the LED indicator will turns off. There are 3 methods for the wall controller to quit “inclusion mode”:</p> <ol><li>Automatically quits after successful inclusion.</li> <li>Quits after 25 seconds timeout.</li> <li>Press and hold down “ALL ON/OFF” button for over 3 seconds, or short press the “inclusion/exclusion” button to quit.</li> </ol><br /><h2>Exclusion Information</h2><p>Exclusion (Remove the device from a Z-Wave network) There are two exclusion methods:</p> <p><strong>Method 1:</strong> Exclusion from the primary controller/gateway as follows:</p> <ol><li>Set the primary controller/gateway into exclusion mode (Please refer to your primary controllers manual on how to set your controller into exclusion).</li> <li>Short press the “inclusion/exclusion” button, or press and hold down “ALL ON/OFF” button for over 3 seconds, the wall controller will be set to exclusion mode, and waiting to be excluded, then LED indicator turns on and shows 3 short blinks and 1 long blink to indicate successful exclusion.</li> </ol><p>Once the wall controller quits “exclusion mode”, the LED indicator will turns off. There are 3 methods for the wall controller to quit “exclusion mode”:</p> <ol><li>Automatically quits after successful exclusion.</li> <li>Quits after 25 seconds timeout.</li> <li>Press and hold down “ALL ON/OFF” button for over 3 seconds, or short press the “inclusion/exclusion” button to quit.</li> </ol><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> Factory reset the wall controller will force the wall controller to be excluded from a network. (please refer to the part “Factory Reset” of this manual)Note:</p> <p>Factory reset is not recommended for exclusion, please use this procedure only if the primary controller/gateway is missing or otherwise inoperable.</p> <p><strong>How to check whether the wall controller already included to a network</strong><br />Operate any button to check if there is indication from the LED indicator, and no LED indication means the wall controller does not belong to any network. If the wall controller already belongs to a network, follow the exclusion process before including it in your network. Otherwise inclusion of this device will fail.</p> <p><strong>Factory Reset</strong><br />Press and hold down “inclusion/exclusion” button for over 8 seconds, LED indicator will blink slowly to indicate successful factory reset, release “inclusion/exclusion” button, the wall controller will restart automatically. If this controller is the primary controller for your network, resetting it will result in the nodes in your network being orphaned and it will be necessary after the reset to exclude and re-include all of the nodes in the network. If this controller is being used as a secondary controller in the network, use this procedure to reset this controller only in the event that the network primary controller is missing or otherwise inoperable.</p>
